on the living room of a snowy cottage at the North Pole. A large, inviting easy chair and a television dominate the room. SANTA CLAUS is discovered si ting in the easy chair beside a TV table on which there is a pitcher of eggnog and a bowl of Doritos. He looks slightly disheveled. His jacket and boots are off; he is wearing his red pants, a t-shirt and suspenders. He picks up the remote and clicks it. SANTA I don’t believe it. (calling off stage) It happened again! MRS. CLAUS (off stage) What happened again? -—— SANTA The DVR thing. It didn’t tape the football game I was gonna watch. East Carolina vs. Boise state. MRS. CLAUS (off stage) Oh. SANTA (calling off stage) What did I do wrong? MRS. CLAUS (off stage) I don’t know, dear. SANTA (calling off stage) J mean, I can fly around the world in one night but I can’t set the DVR! What's wrong with me? ELF—THE MuSIcaL MRS. CLAUS (off stage) I don’t know, dear. He turns off the TV. Hey. They‘Il be here at six. SANTA (to audience) In-laws. They come every year on Christmas day. I finish my rounds, just start to unwind, then the door bursts open and the kids run in, start dancing with the elves and the elves get into the eggnog and start riding the reindeer. Now, don’t get mewrong; I’m a big fan of Christmas. It’s just, well, I had fifty bucks on Boise. What am I complaining about? It’s Christmas! Let’s read a Christmas story. (He picks up a large book) Ah. Here’s one. The story of Buddy the Elf— 1—Happy All The Time* —well, he thought he was an elf —we'll get to that part. Oh! You know what? Before we start I’m going to turn off my cell phone. It’s pretty irritating when one of these things goes off in the middle of a story. Gonna unwrap my candies now too. Okay. It begins once upon a time, in a little village here at the North Pole called Christmas Town. Now this town is unique for two reasons: One, there’s no Starbucks; and two: everyone who lives here is a elf.

BUDDY is making Etch-A-Sketches clumsily. Pieces fly from his table. CHARLIE walks along the line. CHARLIE How you doing, Buddy? BUDDY Um, fine Charlie, but....I guess I’m gonna be a little short on today’s quota. CHARLIE That’s all right, Buddy. Just tell me, how many Etch-A-Sketches did you get finished? = ; (BUDDY embarrassed, fights back tears) C’mon, Buddy, how many? BUDDY I made, uh, eighty-five! MUSIC out as all ELVES gasp and stare at BUDDY CHARLIE (snaps open his work schedule scroll) Eighty-five? It’s ten a.m. and you've only made eighty-five? BUDDY Why don’t you just say it? I’m the worst toy maker in the whole wide world. "ma Cotton-Headed-Ninny-Muggins. CHARLIE You're not a Catton-Headed-Ninny-Muggins. You have lots of talents, uh, special talents in fact, like, uh...

CHARLIE motions to TIARA to join him. CHARLIE Hey, Tiara. TIARA Yeah, Charlie? CHARLIE I hate to do this to you but do you think you could pick up the slack with those Etch-A-Sketches? BUDDY returns immediately with the cocoa cart. He listens, unnoticed by CHARLIE and TIARA. TIARA No problem. CHARLIE Il appreciate it. Buddy’s killing me. TIARA Hey, that was quick thinking with that ‘special talents’ thing. - - ELF-—THE Musical CHARLIE I feel bad for the big guy. I just hope he doesn't get wise.

Is it true what they said? Am I human. SANTA Good question. SANTA walks BUDDY over to a snow drift. Here. Sit on Santa’s lap. I have to tell you a story (reacting to his weight)Oh. You're a big boy. Once upon a time there was this young woman, Susan Welles she had a baby, but she passed away soon after he was born. That baby was put in an orphanage and one Christmas night he crawled into my toy sack and I brought him back here by mistake. The Elves took him in, raised him as one of their own. BUDDY Really? Where is he? Is it Charlie? SANTA Buddy, it’s you! It’s your story! - ELF-—THE MUSICAL BUDDY I’m not an elf; ’ma human. And I’man orphan. Just like Annie! SANTA Not exactly, You have a human father, but he never knew that you were born. He lives in a far-away land called New York City. SANTA takes out a New York city snow globe and hands it to BUDDY. And he works... (points to the globe) ..tight there, in the Empire State Building. BUDDY In there? He must be teeny-tiny! SANTA Trust me, it’s actually a very tall building. BUDDY tries to give the snow globe back but SANTA stops him. Keep it. It’s a gift from me. BUDDY Thank you, Santa.” ELVES Awwwwww. SANTA turns to the gathered elves. SANTA All right, break it up. Nothing to see here. Back to work. BUDDY What's my dad like? SANTA Oh. Well, he’s a very successful man. An executive. He publishes children’s books. BUDDY Oh! SANTA But I should tell you, he, uh....well, he’s on the Naughty List. BUDDY No! What did he do? Did he wet the bed? ELF—THE MusIcCAL 13 SANTA No, he didn’t wet the —look, he just doesn’t believe in me anymore. BUDDY Doesn't believe in you? Is he insane? SANTA No, like a lot of human beings these days, he’s just lost the Christmas Spirit. BUDDY But Christmas Spirit is what makes your sleigh fly! SANTA I know. It’s becoming a problem. He looks into the snow globe. Buddy, it’s time you went there to meet him. I’m going to miss you, that’s for sure, but you’re like a bird; a big hairy bird and it’s time that you left the nest. BUDDY But I don’t want to go to New York. I’m scared. SANTA should know. And it’s very important. BUDDY What? SANTA There are like seven Ray’s pizzas and they all say they are the original, but the real one’s on Sixth Avenue and Eleventh Street. BUDDY Okay. Which direction is New York? SANTA walks BUDDY upstage to an iceberg. SANTA It’s south, We're at the North Pole, Buddy; everything is South. Just head south until you find yourself in a big, smelly, industrial wasteland. BUDDY And that’s New York? SANTA No, that’s New Jersey. Then you just go through the Lincoln Tunnel and you're there. -—- = ELFE-—THE MusIcal BUDDY steps onto a small ice floe.

Later the same day, shortly after noon. A sign in a reception area, stage right, indicates that we are in the offices of Greenway Press, “Children’s Books Your Child Can Trust.” A secretary, DEB, is seated at a reception desk. There is a large office area with EMPLOYEES working in cubicles. Stage center there’s a door to a private office whichopens as the scene begins. WALTER HOBBS appears in the door, he has a children's book in hand and a sheaf of papers. SAM We got a problem, Mr. Hobbs. “Jingles The Jolly Christmas Puppy” is tanking in every bookstore in the country. WALTER Why? SAM Because two whole pages are missing from the last chapter. WALTER What? SAM Without them the end of the book makes no sense. WALTER How did that happen? SAM I don’t know but you yourself okayed the final proofs. We'll have to recall all copiesand reprint. WALTER No, we won't. Kids don’t read the books, anyway, they just look at the pictures. No recall! SAM You really want to do that? WALTER No, I want to go to Greenway and say we’re taking a fifty-thousand dollar bath so some stupid five-year-old can find out what happened to Jingles the friggin’ Puppy on Christmas Eve. SAM But...? ELF—TuHE MUSICAL WALTER But nothing! SAM Whatever you say, boss. WALTER (calling to DEB)Deb! DEB Yes, Mr. Hobbs. WALTER Coffee! Now! DEB Right away. EMILY and 12-year-old MICHAEL enter.

BUDDY Santa. DEB Santa?! BUDDY Uh-huh, from the North Pole. — DEB From the North Pole! BUDDY Yes.

DEB leaves BUDDY and rushes over to WALTER. #3 —In The Way During the following scene, various other EMPLOYEES come out of their cubicles with papers in hand to speak to their boss.

As the number builds, ALL sing, dance and miraculously decorate the entirestage, dancing up and down the escalators, etc., etc. The STORE ELVES, the MANAGER, and JOVIE (who chooses not to sing), however, never really get into the spirit of the song and cynically perform it with false enthusiasm.

MUSIC underscores as the CHILDREN and PARENTS all scream and FAKE SANTA lunges at BUDDY, starting a fight and rolling all over the stage. BUDDY keeps shouting, “He's a fake! He's a fake!” The MOTHER of the boy yells off stage. MOTHER Help! Someone's beating up Santa Claus! ELF—~THE MusiIcaL 41 Two POLICEMEN (VINNIE and DOUG) appear. They wrestle BUDDY off the FAKE SANTA.

Do you know my dad, Walter Hobbs? POLICEMAN #1 No, but we’ll locate him while you're sitting in a cell cooling your heels. Leading him off. BUDDY Thanks. My heels are incredibly sweaty. How did you know? MUSIC of “Sparkle...” plays off as Scene 6 ends and we transition into... 42 - ELF —THE Musical ACT ONE SCENE MUSIC underscores, “In the Way”. The living room of the Hobbs Central Park Westapartment. Later the same day, early evening. LI GHTS up on MICHAEL and EMILY in the living room working on an elaborate science project — large, weird-looking contraption that’s supposed to be a model of a turbine electricity-producing wind machine. There is a small electric fan on the table along with myriad parts strewn about; an upright light bulb is attached to the contraption. MICHAEL switches on the fan and the contraption makes a lot of clanking noise but obviously doesn’t work. MICHAEL Ah, heck, it still doesn’t work. EMILY Maybe you've got these spinny things on backwards. MICHAEL I don’t know. Dad said he’d help me but he’s not around. Again. He's basically not a dad. EMILY Michael, don’t talk like that. Your father loves you. He’s a caring man, but he— Doorbell chimes. Hold that thought. EMILY opens the door and we see BUDDY standing between two PO LICEMEN. BUDDY (arms out-stretched to hug EMILY) Hi, Mom, I’m home! EMILY (stepping back) Excuse me? POLICEMAN #1 This the Walter Hobbs residence? EMILY Yes? POLICEMAN #2 Our pal Buddy here says Mr. Hobbs is his Dad. ELF—THE MuSICAL 43 EMILY Yes, Officer, we're aware that Buddy thinks he’s Mr. Hobbs’ son, but... POLICEMAN #1 Good. Guess we came to the right place. (to POLICEMAN #2) Let's go. EMILY Wait a second, you can’t just leave him here! POLICEMAN #2 Hey lady, have a heart. It’s almost Christmas and he’s homeless. EMILY Well... POLICEMAN #1 Okay, bye Buddy. BUDDY (as he hugs the two POLICEMAN) Bye, Vinny. Bye, Doug! Thanks a whole lot. And Merry Christmas! POLICEMAN #1 & #2 Merry Christmas!(The two POLICEMEN exit with a wave.) BUDDY Ican stay here! Yay, I can stay here! EMILY Well, yes, but just for tonight. Then you'll have to find a place of your own. BUDDY But I like it here. (notices the contraption on the table) Oh, wow, a model of a turbine wind machine! MICHAEL You know what it is? BUDDY Sure. I’ve built a few of them at Santa’s workshop. - ELF—THE MusIcAlL MICHAEL A few of them? How many? BUDDY Only about seven thousand. This one is kinda weird-looking. You’d never get Santa to okay it. EMILY So, you know Santa pretty well, do you? BUDDY Yes! Santa’s, like, my best friend! MICHAEL You still believe in all that flying reindeer stuff? BUDDY No! Of course not. Santa hasn’t used reindeer for years and years. Ever since he got that nasty letter from PETA. Nowadays the sleigh is powered by Christmas spirit alone. Which is a problem because of people like you. I mean, look at this place; no tinsel, no tree—have you even written your letter to Santa Claus yet? EMILY Buddy, I’m sorry, but I’m too old to write to Santa Claus. MICHAEL Me, too. Way too old. Anyhow...(indicating the contraption) I'm gonna flunk if I can’t get this stupid science project working. BUDDY Tell you what, if you get into the Christmas spirit and write that letter to Santa right now, I'll fix your wind machine. MICHAEL You will? Well....okay, it’s a deal. Okay, Mom? BUDDY Okay, Mom? EMILY (shrugging) Okay. BUDDY goes upstage to the contraption and begins fiddling with it. EMILY and MICHAEL sit down together. EMILY takes out a pen and paper. ELF—THE MuSsICAL 45 (EMILY) So, how do we do this? MICHAEL You’re asking your 12 year old son how to write a letter to Santa Claus? What does that say about this family, mom? EMILY Okay, Dr. Drew. Settle down. Well, in the spirit of Christmas, what do you want for Christmas? #5 —I'll Believe In You MICHAEL I don’t know. I know what I don’t want for Christmas. I DON'T WANT A CHECK THAT'S MADE OUT TO CASH OR A CORPORATE RE-GIFT FROM SOME SECRET STASH I’D LIKE A DAY WITH MY DAD EMILY JUST A DAY? MICHAEL MAKE THAT TWO IF YOU CAN DO THAT SANTA I'LL BELIEVE IN YOU EMILY I DON'T WANT A TRIP TO SOME HIP SALON OR TRENDY PERFUME I'LL NEVER PUT ON I’D LIKE TO FEEL LIKE HE CARES MICHAEL EVEN IF IT’S NOT TRUE MICHAEL & EMILY IF YOU CAN DO THAT SANTA I'LL BELIEVE IN YOU ELF—THE MUSICAL (MICHAEL & EMILY) EVEN THOUGH IT’S BEEN YEARS SINCE YOU’VE HEARD FROM ME | THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH A SHOT IF IT’S TRUE THAT YOU'RE MAGIC, | GUARANTEE WE COULD USE ALL THE MAGIC YOU'VE GOT MICHAEL I CAN GET YOU SOME COOKIES IF THAT’S WHAT IT TAKES I'VE HEARD STORIES AND I KNOW THE DEAL MICHAEL & EMILYYOU JUST SLIDE DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND FIX OUR MISTAKES NOW IF ONLY I THOUGHT YOU WERE REAL MICHAEL IF YOU WERE REAL EMILY I GUESS THAT’S OUR LIST OUR LETTER IS DONE MICHAEL 1S IT REALLY A LIST IF IT ADDS UP TO ONE?

BUDDY All fixed! MICHAEL Yay, Buddy! (hugs BUDDY) You're the man! EMILY (hugs BUDDY and MICHAEL) Nice going, Buddy. The door opens and WALTER enters, carrying his briefcase and weary after a long day of work. HE stops short upon seeing BUDDY, MICHAEL and EMILY all happily hugging each other. WALTER What in the devil is going on here?! . MICHAEL It's Buddy... EMILY He's stayin’ with us! BUDDY Hi, Dad! MICHAEL Look, Buddy fixed my wind machine! (turns on the wind machine) BUDDY See! WALTER Staying with us? What do you mean, Emily, he’s staying with us? (to MICHAEL) Turn that noise off! - ELF—THeE MusIcal EMILY Just for overnight. The police showed up with him. WALTER Oh, for God's sake! MICHAEL Hey Dad, please, look at this, I just switch on the fan and... WALTER Not now! EMILY Michael, why don’t you show Buddy the spare room. (to BUDDY) You can sleep there. It has a futon. Leaving with MICHAEL BUDDY A futon? MICHAEL It’s a kind of bed. BUDDY Oh! I thought it was a robot, like “I am futon”. BUDDY & MICHAEL (doing robot voices) “Tam futon! I am futon!” MICHAEL and BUDDY exit. WALTER Emily, there’s no way — EMILY Walter, he’s homeless and it’s freezing out. We couldn’t just let him sleep in the street. WALTER Okay. There’s a youth hostel over by the west side highway. He can stay there. EMILY Good idea. We'll stick him in a cab and send him to a youth hostel in his elf suit. Or, we could save the cab fare and just beat him up here. ELF—THE MusICAL —- — WALTER All right. One night and that’s it, I want him out of here by a.m. LIGHTS blackout and MUSIC of “I'll Believe In You” plays off as Scene ends and we transition into... _ ELF—THE MUSICAL ACT ONE SCENE Hobbs apartment, the following morning. BUDDY and MICHAEL are having cold spaghetti for breakfast together. MICHAEL Wow, Buddy. Left over spaghetti for breakfast is the best, huh? BUDDY I’ve never had spaghetti before. MICHAEL No way! BUDDY Yes way. At the North Pole, we only eat from the five major food groups; cookies, candy, candy canes, candy corn and syrup. Something's missing... (HE takes a bottle of syrup from his sleeve) Syrup! I never leave home without it! MICHAEL You like sugar, huh? BUDDY Is there sugar in maple syrup? MICHAEL Yes. BUDDY Then yes! MICHAEL You do know that sugar’s bad for your teeth right? BUDDY Of course, that’s why it’s important to chew your sugar carefully, drink lots of syrup and see your dentist twice a day. BUDDY now pours maple syrup all over his spaghetti, and hungrily starts eating. Meanwhile, stage left, in the living room, we hear the SOUND of a door CHIME as EMILY, in a bathrobe, enters and answers the door. She takes a Fed-Ex envelope from a uniformed DOORMAN, closes the door and crosses to sit down in an easy chair. SHE opens the Fed-Ex envelope and begins reading its contents. ELF—THE MusIcalL - —- EMILY Oh, my God... WALTER enters stage left. He spots BUDDY. WALTER Emily. That lunatic is still here. EMILY Yes he is. And he’s not going anywhere.

During the above, we see BUDDY and MICHAEL get up from the kitchen table and go toward the living room to eavesdrop. Now, BUDDY races into the living room to hug WALTER. MICHAEL follows right behind BUDDY. BUDDY Yay! I knew it! I knew it! Dad!!! Dad!!! Dad!!! MICHAEL I got a big brother! This is so cool! I can’t believe it! WALTER (to EMILY) He can’t believe it? Now what are we gonna do? He can’t live here with us, he’s insane. BUDDY I planned out our whole first day, Dad. Just you and me. We'll start by makingsnow angels for two hours, then we'll go ice skating and after that we'll eat a log of Toll House cookie dough as fast as we can and then we'll come back home here and snuggle. WALTER (to himself) Oh, my God. (aloud)We'll have to snuggle some other time, Buddy, because today I’ve got to go to work. You'll be staying here with your, uh, step-mommy. EMILY Oh, no, he won't! I have my annual planning meeting this morning. Your father will stay here with you. WALTER (to EMILY) Dammit, I’m this close to getting fired. EMILY Then take him to work. I bet he could be very helpful around the office. WALTER I can’t believe this is happening. ELF—THE MUSICAL - = (WALTER) (stares at BUDDY) All right, but if you're coming with me you'll have to lose that costume. We'll stop at Brooks Brother’s on the way and get you a suit. BUDDY Oh!

JOVIE I came here last year too, my first Christmas in New York. ELF—THE MUSICAL —- — #7c— Rockefeller Center Skating BUDDY Oh, where’d you come from? JOVIE L.A. BUDDY L.A.? Never heard of that place. I don’t think Santa goes there. JOVIE He doesn’t. Christmases there are surreal. No snow. BUDDY No snow?!? JOVIE I've never even seen snow. I've always wanted to. BUDDY That's the saddest thing I've ever heard. JOVIE Yeah, I’ve been here for almost two years and it hasn’t snowed once, You know, when I was a kid I dreamed of having a snowy Christmas Eve dinner at Tavern on the Green with Billy Crystal. That sounds so stupid. BUDDY No it doesn’t! Who’s Billy Crystal? He sounds magical. JOVIE He's an actor. He was in my favorite movie of all time: “City Slickers”. Anyway, last year I spent Christmas Eve in a square foot studio apartment with no heat binge watching “Gilmore Girls” on Netflix. Sad, huh? BUDDY You know what? We are going to have Christmas Eve Dinner at Tavern on the Green! JOVIE I don’t think so. For one thing, it’s been closed for months. It just re-opened, now it’s even harder to get in. BUDDY My dad can get us a table! He can do anything! — — ELF—THE MusIcAL JOVIE Buddy, don’t promise things you can’t deliver. BUDDY Jovie, I will make your dream come true. I promise. JOVIE Wow, I might actually have a real Christmas. BUDDY You see? You do have Christmas Spirit! JOVIE I guess I do. A little. BUDDY Now you have to spread it around and remember the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear. #8—A Cliristmas Song JOVIE I told you, I don’t sing. BUDDY What do you mean, you don’t sing? JOVIE I mean I don’t sing for anyone, at anytime, under any circumstances, and that includes birthdays, Bar Mitzvahs and especially Christmas. Okay? MUSIC begins. BUDDY leads JOVIE onto the ice and they start skating, and continue throughout the number. BUDDY COME ON, JOVIE, SINGING CAN BE EASY JOVIE Please stop.

MATTHEWS is conspicuously absent. CHADWICK Okay. How about this: a town populated only by tomatoes— WALTER Tomatoes. CHADWICK Little tomato people. They are busily preparing for Christmas, but little do they know, the mean tomato who lives on top of the mountain is planning to steal Christmas this year. WALTER You are describing the Grinch. CHADWICK But with tomatoes! WALTER You’re an idiot, Chadwick. Greenway is going to fire us all if we don’t come up with something good, you understand that? Can you grasp the seriousness of this situation? Where is Matthews? CHADWICK He's working a lead, WALTER He’s what? MATTHEWS bursts in carrying a small manuscript. MATTHEWS I got it! CHADWICK You got it? WALTER An original idea I hope? MATTHEWS We got something better than an idea. — ELF—-THE MuSICAL CHADWICK We got a book. MATTHEWS You are familiar, of course, with Christopher Smith. WALTER Are you kidding? Christopher Smith was the greatest writer of Christmas stories who ever lived. When you think of Christmas you think of Chris Smith. CHADWICK So, you would be happy if we brought him in? WALTER He's dead, you morons. MATTHEWS Mr. Hobbs, I met this guy who deals in used furniture; high end stuff, from the homes of prominent dead writers. So, he recently acquired a desk once owned by one Christopher Smith. CHADWICK And in this desk he finds a secret drawer — MATTHEWS —and in this secret drawer he finds a manuscript. CHADWICK A lost Chris Smith Christmas story! WALTER A lost Chris Smith Christmas story? MATTHEWS It's a Chris Smith Christmas for Walter Hobbs! MATTHEWS hands WALTER a small, yellowing manuscript. WALTER My God. It’s beautiful! MATTHEWS Isn't it?

It's the only copy. CHADWICK Are you nuts? What if someone spills coffee on it? Make a copy! MATTHEWS Relax. The machine’s out of toner. Deb’s changing it now. Just be careful with it, Mr. Hobbs. WALTER (handling it gingerly) This could be huge! Suddenly BUDDY, in his business suit, bursts into the conference room, having just come from his date. BUDDY I'm in love! I’m in love! And I don’t care who knows it! WALTER Buddy, please. We're very busy. BUDDY Dad, I need a table for two at Tavern on The Green, seven o'clock, Christmas Eve. And four hundred dollars.

SANTA Sorry. Sorry. Just made a quick trip to the cocoa cart, if you know what I mean. SANTA settles, and takes a sip of cocoa. Oh. Single malt cocoa. That'll curl your shoes. Okay. Where were we? (opening the book.) Ah, yes. Buddy was not having a very merry Christmas. In fact, it was the worst he could remember, even worse than that year all the elves had winter vomiting disease. After Walter said all those terrible things to him, Buddy went back to the apartment, got back into his elf suit and wrote a note. We see a projection of Buddy's farewell message, which is written on an Etch-a-Sketch. BUDDY (speaking the words we see projected) Dear Dad and Mom and Michael: I’m sorry I ruined your lives....and J also feel real upset about pouring that bottle of maple syrup into your DVD player. My bad. Anyway, thanks for the nifty suit and coat but I won’t be needing them anymore. | don’t belong here with you. I don’t belong at the North Pole, either. I’ll never forget you, love and goodbye forever, Buddy. P. S. Merry Christmas. SANTA (0O.5S.) After that, Buddy wandered all night and all the next day, cold and alone, through the streets of the city. BUDDY, now once again in his elf costume, enters and trudges forlornly alone through a projected Manhattan street. By then he was hungry, and he happened to stumble upon the only place in New York where a sad Elf can get a cheap meal on Christmas Eve... Fe comes upon the exterior of a Chinese restaurant, the Chung Fu Palace. As we segueinto the next scene, the time is a day later, early on the evening of the 24th. — ELF—THE MusSsIcat ACT TWO SCENE The interior of the Chung Fu Palace Christmas Eve. It is early evening. All of the customers are dressed as Santa Claus since each is now an out-of-work department store or Salvation Army street-corner Santa. They pick at their food and commiserate.

I can’t take any more of your crazy stories. BUDDY But it’s true! And, oh, Jovie, Iam so, so sorry I ruined your Christmas dream. JOVIE Forget it. It’s my fault. I knew you couldn't get a table. But still, got all dressed up and came here. And then an hour went by, then another hour and I waited. I didn’t leave. Why? Because our date on Thursday was the only good time I’ve had in the last year and a half. How sad is that? BUDDY That is sad. But it’s nice, too. JOVIE I just thought that if anyone could give mea real Christmas it would be you. “Lower your expectations, so you don’t get disappointed”. I should have that tattooed on my forehead. BUDDY Jovie I feel so bad about this, sick in my stomach, like I swallowed a zillion sticks of Juicy Fruit. The last thing in the whole wide world I wanted to do was hurt you.

It’s real special. I mean, I know you’re not going to believe me, but Santa Claus gave it to me when I left the North Pole. JOVIE Oh, Buddy. so, so wish that were true. Goodbye. JOVIE leaves.

Nobody wants me, Nobody needs me.” Poor thing, wandering the streets in that dorky elf suit. MICHAEL Why did he do it? EMILY He had a fight with your father. (examining the Etch-a-sketch more closely) This really is amazing. I can barely draw a straight line on one of these things. MICHAEL We have to find him! We have to bring him home! -- EMILY We will find him, but after that I think we need to get him some help. MICHAEL What do you mean “help”? EMILY Professional help. Honey, Buddy is crazy. MICHAEL Mom. EMILY No, he is. We have to accept that. MICHAEL He’s my brother. EMILY I know. You have a crazy brother. Lot's of people do.

MICHAEL What about little kids? Are they crazy too? EMILY It's different. If a little kid believes in a talking purple dinosaur, it’s delightful. If he still believes when he’s thirty, it’s profoundly disturbing. Look, just because Buddy is crazy, doesn’t mean we should love him any less. I have a friend who's a psychiatrist. You remember Barry? With the Ferrari? I’m going to give him a call right now. Maybe he can tell us where we should look for Buddy. EMILY leaves the room. MICHAEL wanders over to an upstage window.

WALTER I want your resignation on my desk in the morning. In the meantime, keep thinking. They are all silent. DEB May I make a suggestion? WALTER Anything. DEB Whenever we visited my Grammy in Budapest, she would tell us the story of little Palko, the one-legged boy.

ELF—THE MusIcalL ~ 91 DEB Yes, because he’d been a very good boy. WALTER That’s the most disgusting story I’ve ever heard. DEB (defensively) Well, it’s incredibly touching when you hear it in Hungarian. EMILY and MICHAEL burst in. EMILY Walter — MICHAEL Dad. You're not gonna believe what we just saw — WALTER Emily, for God sakes, you have no idea how important it is that I continue working on this pitch. EMILY No. We have to talk, Walter. Right now.

WALTER Excuse me? GREENWAY I want to make it a horse instead of an elf. CHADWICK You mean, a horse, like— MATTHEWS With a saddle and a tail...? GREENWAY Yeah. A horse. WALTER Interesting.... Why? GREENWAY Market research. Horses score really big with gweens. EMILY Gweens? GREENWAY Girl tweens. WALTER So, you want our Christmas story to be about a horse who grows up at the North Pole...

ELF—THE MusiIcat - (WALTER) (to GREENWAY) Mr. Greenway, Michael and Buddy are my sons. I'd prefer that you didn’t insult them. GREENWAY And I'd prefer that you keep your wife and your whole weirdo family out of the office and do your job! Now you got a good idea here, Hobbs. With work, it could be a million seller, so this is what we're going to do: I’m going to cancel my flight, we’re going to work all night and all day tomorrow until we— WALTER (interrupting him) Tomorrow? Tomorrow’s Christmas. GREENWAY You got a problem with that? WALTER Yes. Mr. Greenway? I quit. GREENWAY What? WALTER I quit. GREENWAY Let me get this straight. You want to spend Christmas on the unemployment line? WALTER No I want to spend Christmas with my family, but I'd be happy to spend it anywhere, as long as it’s not with you. WALTER gives MICHAEL and BUDDY a high five. MICHAEL All right, Dad! BUDDY Yes, Dad! GREENWAY (packing up his things and storming out) You're weak, Hobbs!

And my little brother— _ ELF—~THE MusIcAl SANTA It’s the same thing every year: I get a boost over Vermont, but as soon as I hit the Tri-State area, it’s lights out. Like I’m entering a black hole.

WALTER Buddy, you shouldn’t have run off— They stop and stare in stunned silence. BUDDY Dad, Mom, Michael? I'd like you to meet my really, really good friend, Santa Claus. WALTER Oh, my God.

ELF—THE MUSICAL — - (SANTA) (stabbing at the iPad) f Let's see....No, that’s “Fruit Ninja”. Okay, here we are. Letters to Santa....Michael ia Hobbs: “All I want for Christmas is a day with my dad.” A real tear-jerker. MICHAEL Oh, man! I can’t wait to tell the guys at school about this. They'll freak!

SANTA turns to WALTER. SANTA So, Walter. Can I take you off the naughty list, or not? Everyone stares at hit. WALTER You know what? It’s been a crazy week, I found out I have a son, who was raised by elves; I told off my boss, I quit my job....I’m a little disoriented right now. BUDDY Come on, dad! Santa’s standing right in front of you! WALTER I'm just saying....it doesn’t matter if can’t wrap my head around all of this. The important thing is; Buddy, if you believe in Santa Claus, then believe in Santa Claus. SANTA That's good enough for me. You're off the naughty list. #13a— Thank You, Santa BUDDY (with great enthusiasm) Yes! - ELF—THE MuSICAL The sleigh slightly rises and then settles back on the ground. MICHAEL Look! Look at the sleigh! SANTA It's not enough. Sure could use a few magic reindeer about now. Thank you PETA! Well, that’s it. BUDDY What do you mean? SANTA I mean it’s over. No more Christmas. I guess it’s time I considered another line of business. My Brother-in-law owns a Chipotle in Boca. BUDDY Santa! SANTA I'm not talking about working there, I’m talking about a franchise. Well, don't look at me like that. If nobody believes in Santa anymore, what can I do? Oh, it breaks my heart to disappoint all those kids. BUDDY I'm not gonna give up. I know I can get you all the Christmas spirit you need, I’ve just got to find enough people to talk to... (grabbing SANTA’s iPad) I have to borrow this! SANTA What?! Wait! I haven't backed it up yet! BUDDY, MICHAEL, EMILY and WALTER hurry off. The lights go slowly down on SANTA and we transition into... ELF-—THE MusIcal = 107 ACT TWO SCENE Central Park West, just outside Central Park. A few minutes later. A New York remote news telecast is on the air live. Microphone in hand, CHARLOTTE DENNON stands in the midst of a large crowd of onlookers. MI CHAEL runs on, followed by BUDDY, EMILY and WALTER. CHARLOTTE Charlotte Dennon, NY1, continuing our live coverage from Central Park. No evidence has yet been found of the UFO that apparently crashed in the Park earlier this evening. But could there be another explanation? Perhaps what you millions of New York One viewers saw was Santa Claus making his rounds in the skies above Manhattan, delivering toys to all good little boys and girls— BUDDY (grabbing the microphone and looking into the camera)That's exactly what people saw, only the sleigh crashed because there isn’t enough Christmas spirit. CHARLOTTE It seems that one of Santa’s Elves has joined us. BUDDY [ know, I know everybody in New York thinks I’m crazy. But I’ve come here to tell you that Santa is real. CHARLOTTE Well, I’m afraid that’s all the time we have for... BUDDY (pointing to a man in the crowd) Look! Ihave Santa’s iPad right here! You, sir, what's your name? MAN #1 David Lambert.

BUDDY No, it’s right here! CHARLOTTE (losing her cool) Okay. That’s it. I don’t know how you're doing this, but I’m not an idiot. Everybody knows that there is no Santa Claus. (realizing what she has just said.) Omigod! I ruined Christmas. BUDDY You didn’t ruin Christmas. No one can! (turning to the crowd) Oh, I could stand here all night reading names out of this thing and you still wouldn’t believe in him, would you? Well, it doesn’t matter, because Christmas is a lot more than just Santa Claus. Christmas is....is....sleeping on a futon. Having cold spaghetti for breakfast with your little brother. Right? It’s going ice skating with your girlfriend and kissing her for the very first time under a big, glittery Christmas tree. It's travelling miles and miles to be with your family, walking through the Lincoln tunnel with cars blowing their horns the whole time and truck drivers yelling things that no person should say to another human being, let alone to an elf. ELF-—THE MuSICAL —- - (BUDDY) It's hoping that when you wake up on Christmas morning all the cars, and all the big grey office buildings, and all the piles of garbage will be covered in snow. EE ii A light snow begins te fall. You see? You can’t ruin Christmas! It’s all acound you. You just got to get into the spirit of it. And the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear! Everybody! Sing! Sing! Anybody?
