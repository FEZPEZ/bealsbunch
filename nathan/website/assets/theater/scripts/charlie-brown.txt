LINUS: I really don't think you have anything to worry about Charlie Brown. After all, science has shown a person's character isn't really established until at he's at least five years old. CHARLIE BROWN: But I am five! I'm more than five! LINUS: Oh well, that's the way it goes. CHORUS: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN. SALLY: The only thing wrong with my big brother Charlie Brown is his lack of confidence. His inferiority, and his lack of confidence. His clumsiness, his inferiority, and his lack of confidence. His stupidity, his clumsiness, his inferiority, and his lack of confidence. . . . CHORUS: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN CHARLIE BROWN. LUCY: Charlie Brown. . . . CHORUS: YOU'RE THE KIND OF REMINDER WE NEED. . . SCHROEDER: Did you know that Charlie Brown has never pitched a winning baseball game? Never been able to keep a kite in the air? Never won a game of checkers? And never successfully punted a football? Sometimes I marvel at his consistency. CHORUS: YOU HAVE HUMILITY, NOBILITY AND A SENSE OF HONOR THAT IS VERY RARE INDEED. LINUS: I think Charlie Brown has nice hands. SNOOPY: It is truly a dog's life. A life of challenges -- You try acting excited when that round headed kid comes home from school! ALL: YOU'RE A PRINCE AND A PRINCE COULD BE KING. LUCY: Now Linus, I want you to take a good look at Charlie Brown's face. Would you please hold still a minute Charlie Brown. I want Linus to study your face. Now, this is what you call a failure face, Linus. Notice how it has failure written all over it. Study it carefully. You rarely see such a good example. Notice the deep lines, the dull vacant look in his eyes -- yes I would say this is the finest example of a failure face you're liable to see in a long while. ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN. CHARLIE BROWN: Some days I wake up early and watch the sun rise. And I think how beautiful it is. How my life lies before me. And I get very positive feeling about things . . . Like this morning for instance, the sky is so clear and the sun is so bright. . . How can anything go wrong on a day like this? (alarm clock rings) I'm late!! SNOOPY: Woof! ALL (EXCEPT CHARLIE BROWN) YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN, YOU'RE THE KIND OF REMINDER WE NEED. YOU HAVE HUMILITY, NOBILITY AND A SENSE OF HONOR. THAT IS VERY RARE INDEED. SNOOPY: Woof! ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN, AND WE KNOW YOU WILL GO VERY FAR. YES, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, ALMOST FRIGHTENING TO CONCEIVE, WHAT A GOOD MAN YOU ARE. LINUS: You are kind. ALL: (all the animals enter) YOU ARE KIND TO ALL THE ANIMALS AND EVERY LITTLE BIRD. WITH A HEART OF GOLD YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE TOLD. LUCY: Every single solitary word. ALL: YOU BRAVELY FACE ADVERSITY, YOU'RE CHEERFUL THROUGH THE DAY, YOU'RE THOUGHTFUL, BRAVE AND COURTEOUS. LUCY: And you also have some faults, but for the moment let's just say.... ALL: THAT YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN, YOU'RE A PRINCE, AND A PRINCE COULD BE KING. WITH A HEART SUCH AS YOURS YOU COULD OPEN ANY DOORS, YOU COULD GO OUT AND DO ANYTHING. YOU COULD BE KING, CHARLIE BROWN, YOU COULD BE KING! CHARLIE BROWN: EVERYBODY SAYS TO ME ALL (EXCEPT CHARLIE BROWN): YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN CHARLIE BROWN: EVERY VOICE IN HARMONY ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN CHARLIE BROWN: ALL I NEED IS ONE MORE TRY GOTTA GET THAT KITE TO FLY AND I'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY WHO GIVES UP EASILY. WONDER WHY THEY STOP TO SAY ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN CHARLIE BROWN: NEVER LIKED ME ANYWAY ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN CHARLIE BROWN: TRYING NOT TO ROCK THE BOAT NOT TO MAKE A SCENE A GOOD MAN YES, BUT I CONFESS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN. I WANT TO RISE LIKE I SHOULD AND DO EVERYTHING RIGHT BUT I LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT ALL: OOOH.... NEVER SLEEP CHARLIE BROWN: WITH QUESTIONS IN MY EAR ALL: OOOH.... LOUD AND DEEP CHARLIE BROWN: I WANT TO JOIN THE DANCE ALL: OOOH.... TAKE THE LEAP CHARLIE BROWN: BUT THE ANSWER ISN'T CLEAR THEN I HEAR ALL: CHARLIE BROWN.... CHARLIE BROWN.... YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN (The School bus horn Beep-Beeps) CHILD 1: Get on the bus. CHILD 2: Get on the bus. CHILD 3: Go ahead, get on the bus, Charlie Brown. CHILD 4: Don't wanna be late for school. ALL: That's right! CHARLIE BROWN: Don't wanna be late. ALL: Don't wanna be late for school! YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN, CHARLIE BROWN: THERE THEY GO AGAIN. ALL: YOU'RE THE KIND OF REMINDER WE NEED. CHARLIE BROWN: DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN ALL: YOU HAVE HUMILITY, NOBILITY AND A SENSE OF HONOR. THAT IS VERY RARE INDEED. CHARLIE BROWN: I'M NOT GOOD, I'M NOT BAD I'M SOMETHING IN BETWEEN SNOOPY: Woof! ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN, CHARLIE BROWN: I DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL: YOU'RE A PRINCE, AND A PRINCE COULD BE KING. WITH A HEART SUCH AS YOURS YOU COULD OPEN ANY DOORS, YOU COULD GO OUT AND DO ANYTHING. YOU COULD BE KING, CHARLIE BROWN, YOU COULD BE KING! CHARLIE BROWN: NOTHING LASTS FOREVER ALL: YOU COULD BE KING! CHARLIE BROWN: ALL GOOD THINGS MUST END ALL: BELIEVE IT CHARLIE BROWN: I'VE MEMORIZED THAT PHRASE BY HEART ALL: AND YOU WERE BORN FOR THIS PART CHARLIE BROWN: SO TELL ME ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN CHARLIE BROWN: I NEED TO KNOW IT... ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN CHARLIE BROWN CHARLIE BROWN: WHEN DO THE GOOD THINGS START? CHORUS 1: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN CHARLIE BROWN YOU'RE A GOOD MAN CHARLIE BROWN CHORUS 2 BRAVELY FACING ADVERSITY YOU CAN OPEN UP ANY DOOR CHORUS 3 OH, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN CHARLIE BROWN (music cue) (The kids go into school, and Snoopy tries to follow them in, but the door shuts in his face - he whimpers) Scene 2 - SCHOOL SALLY: This is my report on the past. The past has always interested people. I must admit, however, that I don't know much about it. I wasn't here when it happened. (school bell and music) CHARLIE BROWN: (sitting on the bench) I think lunchtime is about the worst time of the day for me. Always having to sit here alone. Of course, sometimes mornings aren't so pleasant, either - waking up and wondering if anyone would really miss me if I never got out of bed. Then there's the night, too - lying there and thinking about all the stupid things I've done during the day. And all those hours in between - when I do all those stupid things. Well, lunchtime is among the worst times of the day for me. Well, I guess I'd better see what I've got. Peanut Butter. Some psychiatrists say that people who eat peanut butter sandwiches are lonely. I guess they're right. And when you're really lonely, the peanut butter sticks to the roof of your mouth (he says this while chewing. Then he gets the peanut butter unstuck with his finger.) Boy the PTA sure did a good job of painting these benches. There's that cute little redheaded girl eating her lunch over there. I wonder what she'd do if I went over and asked her if I could sit and have lunch with her. She'd probably laugh right in my face. It's hard on a face when it gets laughed in. There's an empty place next to her on the bench. There's no reason why I couldn't just go over and sit there. I could do that right now. All I have to do is stand up. (He stands up.) I'm standing up. (He sits down) I'm sitting down. I'm a coward. I'm so much of a coward she probably wouldn't even think of looking at me. She hardly ever does look at me. In fact, I can't remember her ever looking at me. Why shouldn't she look at me? Is there any reason in the world why she shouldn't look at me? Is she so great and I'm so small that she can't spare one little moment... (He stops) She's looking at me. She's looking at me. (He panics and puts his lunch bag on his head.) LUCY:(entering with a friend) No, you're thinking of that other dress, the one I wore to Lucinda's Party. The one I'm talking about was the very light blue one and it had a design embroidered around the waist. FRIEND: I don't remember. LUCY: (She takes a pencil and draws on the paper bag) Something like this. The skirt went out like this and it had these puffy sleeves and a sash like this. FRIEND: Oh yes, I remember. LUCY: Yes, well that was the dress I was wearing last week when I met Frieda and she said she'd seen one just like it over at... CHARLIE BROWN: (Still with the bag on his head) Lunchtime IS among the worst times of day for me. If that little redheaded girl is looking at me with this stupid bag over my head she must think I'm the biggest fool alive. But if she isn't looking at me, then maybe I could take it off quickly and she'd never notice it. On the other hand, I can't tell if she's looking or not until I take it off. Then again, if I never take it off, I'll never have to know if she was looking or not. On the other hand, it's very hard to breathe in here. (He pauses... then quickly pulls the bag off his head.) She's not looking at me. I wonder why she never looks at me. (The school bell rings again.) Oh well, one more lunch hour over with. Only two thousand, eight hundred and sixty-three to go. CHARLIE BROWN: ALL I NEED IS ONE MORE TRY GOTTA GET THAT KITE TO FLY AND I'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY WHO GIVES UP EASILY ALL: YOU'RE A GOOD MAN YOU'RE A GOOD MAN scene 3 - recess SCHROEDER LUCY: D'YA KNOW SOMETHING SCHROEDER? I THINK THEY WAY YOU PLAY THE PIANO IS NICE. D'YA KNOW SOMETHING ELSE? IT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM, THAT I'D MARRY A MAN WHO PLAYS THE PIANO. AT PARTIES HE PLAYS SOMETHING NICE LIKE APRIL SHOWERS. I'M SURE YOU COULD PLAY SOMETHING NICE LIKE APRIL SHOWERS. OR EVEN FRERE JACQUES BEETHOVEN'S NICE TOO. JUST IMAGINE... WHAT WOULD YOU THINK IF SOMEDAY YOU AND I SHOULD GET MARRIED? WOULDN'T YOU LIKE THAT IF SOME DAY WE TWO SHOULD GET MARRIED. (Schroeder ducks under his piano.) LUCY: My Aunt Marian was right. Never try to discuss marriage with a musician. ---------------------------------------------------------------- LINUS: Happiness is a fleeting thing, Sally, but I think that a man can come closer to it by directing the forces of his life to a single goal that he believes in. And I think that a man's personal search for happiness is not really a selfish thing, either, because by achieving happiness himself, he can help others to find it. Does that make sense to you? SALLY: We had spaghetti at our house three times this week. (music) ---------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------- (snoopy is center stage as different kids come up to him and exit) KID 1: Hey Snoopy, How’s the fella? KID 2: Hi Snoopy, cute doggie. KID 3: What d’ya say, tiger? KID 4: Hi Fuzzy Face. KID 5: Hi Snoopy. SNOOPY: Nobody ever calls me sugarlips. ---------------------------------------------------------------- LUCY:(entering, following charlie brown) You know a princess sort of thing... a white dress and nice slippers, oh, and a big ballroom. CHARLIE BROWN: Uh-huh. LUCY: But, I guess that's kind of silly isn't it Charlie Brown? CHARLIE BROWN: Oh no, not at all. I mean, well, we all have our little daydreams or ambitions or whatever you want to call them. I mean there's one I've had myself for years only I've never told anyone. LUCY: What? You can tell me. CHARLIE BROWN: Oh no, it's not the sort of thing I should tell. No, I don't think I should. LUCY: Oh, come on please. I wouldn't give it away. Come on, PLEASE. CHARLIE BROWN: Well, I've always wanted to be called Flash. I hate the name Charlie. I'd like to be real athletic so that everybody would call me Flash. I’d like to be so good at everything that all around school I'd be known as Flash. LUCY: (yells) Hey, Freida. Listen to this one! (She runs off laughing.) (music) (Sally enters with her jump rope) CHARLIE BROWN: What's the matter Sally? SALLY: I don't know. I was jumping rope... everything was fine. Then suddenly it all seemed so futile. ---------------------------------------------------------------- (music starts when schroeder is in place) SCHROEDER: Beethoven used to be fond of taking long walks in the country. He was always inspired by the beautiful sounds of the country side. LINUS: (He Screams) AAAAAGGGGGGHHHH LUCY: Gimme back my ball you blockhead! SCHROEDER: Beethoven had it nice. (music) Scene 4 - Snoopy’s Nap time SONG: SNOOPY (snoopy is asleep on his doghouse, dreaming of all the wonderful things his friends are saying about him - all lines are said over the dream music) CHARLIE BROWN: (offstage) Hey, Snoopy, we're home from school. Hi there, fella. Gosh, it's good to see ya. LUCY: (offstage) Oh, Snoopy, you're so adorable. CHARLIE BROWN (offstage): Okay, Snoopy, I'll be out later with your supper. SALLY (offstage): I think Snoopy's such a wonderful dog. SCHROEDER: Me too. He's just about the best there is. SNOOPY: (Singing from his doghouse.) THEY LIKE ME, I THINK THEY'RE SWELL. ISN'T IT REMARKABLE HOW THINGS TURN OUT SO WELL? PLEASANT DAY, PRETTY SKY, LIFE GOES ON, HERE I LIE NOT BAD, NOT BAD AT ALL. COZY HOME, BOARD AND BED, STURDY ROOF BENEATH MY HEAD. NOT BAD, NOT BAD AT ALL. (woodstock birds and bunnies enter) FAITHFUL FRIENDS ALWAYS NEAR ME, BRING ME BONES, SCRATCH MY EAR. LITTLE BIRDS COME TO CHEER ME, EVERY DAY SITTING HERE ON MY STOMACH WITH THEIR SHARP LITTLE CLAWS WHICH ARE USUALLY COLD AND OCCASIONALLY PAINFUL, AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE SO MANY THAT I CAN HARDLY STAND IT Rats! (Snoopy stands up and all the other animals and the chorus enters with kazoos) I FEEL EVERY NOW AND THEN THAT I GOTTA BITE SOMEONE. I KNOW EVERY NOW AND THEN WHAT I WANNA BE, A FIERCE JUNGLE ANIMAL CROUCHED ON THE LIMB OF A TREE. CHORUS: LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA SNOOPY: LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA I'D STAY VERY, VERY STILL 'TIL I SEE A VICTIM COME. I'D WAIT, KNOWING VERY WELL EVERY SECOND COUNTS, AND THEN, LIKE THE FIERCE JUNGLE CREATURE I AM, I WOULD POUNCE. I'D POUNCE! I'D POUNCE!! I'D POU... WOW...WOW WOW. . . You know, I never realized it was so far down to the ground from up here. (everyone exits, disappointed that snoopy lost his “pounce”) HMMM. LET ME SEE, WHERE WAS I? OH, THAT'S RIGHT. PRETTY SKY. NOT BAD, NOT BAD AT ALL. COZY HOME, BOARD AND BED, STURDY ROOF BENEATH MY HEAD. NOT BAD, NOT BAD AT ALL. NOT BAD, NOT BAD AT ALL. I wonder if it will snow tonight. . . Aroooooooooo! Scene 5 - After School CHARLIE BROWN: I think I'll just walk right up to that little red-haired girl and introduce myself. I think I'll introduce myself and then I think I'll ask her to come over here and sit next to me. I think I'll ask her to sit by me and then I think I'll tell her how much I've always admired her... I think I'll flap my arms and fly to the moon. ---------------------------------------------------------------- SNOOPY: Yesterday, I was a dog. Today, I'm a dog. Tomorrow, I'll probably still be a dog. There's just so little hope of advancement. ---------------------------------------------------------------- LUCY: Today is April fools day Charlie Brown. I think I'll play a little trick on you. I think I'll try a little trick. You understand what I'm saying don't you? You understand this is April fools day? You sure? I want to be certain you understand. Okay! Hey Charlie Brown, guess what! That little red-haired girl is over there and she wants to give you a hug and kiss. CHARLIE BROWN: Really? Wow, this is fantastic! LUCY: April fool!! Just like shooting fish in a barrel. ---------------------------------------------------------------- LINUS: Snoopy! Do you see this stick? I, the human being, will throw the stick and you, the dog, will retrieve it. SNOOPY: I, the dog, could not be less interested. ---------------------------------------------------------------- LUCY: I got it, I got it! (she laughs) LINUS: Arrgghh!! (A big chasing scene begins.) LINUS: You give me back my blanket. LUCY: No! I've got it and I'm going to keep it. This is just the start you need to help you break this disgusting habit. LINUS: Apparently you haven't read the latest scientific reports. A blanket is as important to a child as a hobby is to an adult. Many a man spends his time restoring antique automobiles, or building model trains, or collecting old telephones, or even studying about the Civil War. This is called playing with the past. LUCY: Really? LINUS: Certainly. And this is good, for it helps these men to cope with their everyday problems. Now, I feel that it is going to be absolutely necessary for me to get me blanket back, so I'm just going to have to give it a good YANK! It's surprising what you can accomplish with a little smooth talking and some fast action. MY BLANKET AND ME LINUS: Got ya back again. MMM... Delightful... MMMMMMMMMMMMMM. . . Sucking your thumb without a blanket is like eating a cone without ice cream. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM. . . MY BLANKET AND ME! (he dances) LUCY: Look at my little baby brother Linus, and his little baby blanket. FRIEND 1: There's your baby brother with his silly little blanket. FRIEND 2: Well, you know how babies are with their blanket. LINUS: I am count dracula from transylvania!!! (they scream and run away) IT'S A COZY SANCTUARY BUT IT'S FAR FROM NECESSARY. CAUSE I'M JUST AS SELF-RELIANT AS BEFORE. AS A SIMPLE DEMONSTRATION, OF MY INDEPENDENT STATION. I WILL GO AND LEAVE MY BLANKET ON THE FLOOR. YES, I'LL WALK AWAY AND LEAVE IT, THOUGH I KNOW YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT, I'LL JUST WALK AWAY AND LEAVE IT ON THE FLOOR. LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA I'LL JUST WALK. . . AWAY AND LEAVE IT ON THE..... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Don't ever let me do that again! LUCY: You're a hopeless case Linus. LINUS: I thought I could do it. I actually thought I could do it. (Long Dance sequence - by the end of it everyone is dancing with their blankets too.) LINUS: IT'S FOOLISH, I KNOW IT, I'LL TRY TO OUTGROW IT, BUT MEANWHILE. . . IT'S MY BLANKET AND. . . SOLO 1: AND ME... SOLO 2: AND ME... SOLO 3: AND ME... SOLO 4: AND ME... LINUS: AND ME. LUCY: Linus, do you know what I intend. I intend to be a queen. (Musical fanfare.) When I grow up I'm going to be the biggest queen there ever was. And I'll live in a big palace with a big front lawn and have lots of beautiful dresses to wear. And, when I go out in my coach all the people... LINUS: (interrupting her) Lucy! LUCY: All the people will wave, and I will SHOUT at them. And... LINUS: Lucy, I believe queen is an inherited title. Yes, I am quite sure a person can only be queen by being born into a royal family of the correct lineage so that she can assume the throne after the death of the reining monarch. I can't think of any possible way that you could ever become a queen. I'm sorry Lucy, but it's true. LUCY: And in the summer time, I will go to my summer palace and I will wear my crown in swimming and everything. And all the people will cheer and I will SHOUT at them. (She pauses) WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CAN'T BE A QUEEN!!!!!! LINUS: It's true. LUCY: There must be a loop hole... this kind of thing always has a loop hole. Nobody should be kept from being a queen if she wants to be one. It's undemocratic. LINUS: Good grief! LUCY: It's usually just a matter of knowing the right people. I bet a few pieces of well placed correspondence and I get to be queen in no time. LINUS: I think I'll watch television. LUCY: I know what I'll do. If I can't be a queen, then I'll be very rich. I'll work and work until I'm very rich and then I will buy myself a queendom. LINUS: GOOD GRIEF! LUCY: Yes, I will buy myself a queendom and I'll kick out the old queen and take over the whole operation myself. I will be head queen. And then all the people... when I go out in my coach, all the people will shout at me... (she glances at the tv, becomes engrossed and sits on the couch) LINUS: What’s the matter Lucy? LUCY: Huh? LINUS: What happened to your queendom? LUCY: Oh that, I’ve given it up. I’ve decided to devote my life to cultivating my natural beauty. Now Switch channels! LINUS: Are you kidding? I'm not one of your royal subjects. What makes you think you can just take over? LUCY: These five fingers. Individually they are nothing but when I curl them together into a single unit they become a fighting force terrible to behold. LINUS: Yes, your majesty. Why can't you guys get organized like that?!?! SALLY: A "C"... a "C"... I got a "C" on my coat hanger sculpture. How could anyone get a "C" in coat hanger sculpture? May I ask a question? Was I being judged on the piece of sculpture itself? If so, is it not true that time alone can judge a work of art? Or was I being judged on my talent? If so, is it right that I be judged on a part of life over which I have no control? If I was judged on my effort then I was judged unfairly for I tried as hard as I could. Was I being judged on what I have learned about this project? If so, were then not you, my teacher, also being judged on your ability to transmit your knowledge to me? Are you willing to share my "C"? (High pitched Oh) Well, perhaps I was being judged on the quality of the coat hanger itself, out of which my creation was made. Now is that not also unfair? Am I to be judged by the quality of the coat hangers that are used by our dry cleaning establishment to return our garments. Is this not the responsibility of my parents? Should they not share my "C"? TEACHER'S VOICE: WA WA WA WA WA WA WA WA WA WA WA SALLY: Thank you Miss Othmar. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. THE KITE CHARLIE BROWN: LITTLE MORE SPEED, LITTLE MORE ROPE, LITTLE MORE WIND, LITTLE MORE HOPE, GOTTA GET THIS STUPID KITE TO FLY. GOTTA MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T SNAG, DOESN'T DROOP, DOESN'T DRAG, GOTTA WATCH OUT FOR EVERY LITTLE... WHOOPS! LITTLE LESS SPEED, LITTLE MORE TACK, LITTLE LESS RISE, LITTLE MORE SLACK, GOTTA KEEP MY WITS ABOUT ME NOW. GOTTA MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET THE BEST OF ME TILL I GET IT IN THE AIR SOMEHOW. MILLIONS OF LITTLE KIDS DO IT EVERY DAY, THEY MAKE A KITE AND POOF, IT'S IN THE SKY. LEAVE IT TO ME TO HAVE THE ONE FOOL KITE WHO LIKES TO SEE A LITTLE KID CRY. LITTLE LESS TALK, LITTLE MORE SKILL, LITTLE LESS LUCK, LITTLE MORE WILL, GOTTA FACE THIS FELLOW EYE TO EYE. NOW THAT I'VE SEEN YOU CHASING MOLES, CLIMBING TREES, DIGGING HOLES, CATCHING YOUR STRING ON EVERYTHING PASSING BY, WHY NOT FLY? WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S IT DOING? IT ISN'T ON THE GROUND, IT ISN'T IN A TREE, IT'S IN THE AIR! LOOK AT THAT, IT'S CAUGHT THE BREEZE NOW, IT'S PAST THE TREES NOW, WITH ROOM TO SPARE. OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. AND I'M NOT SUCH A CLUMSY GUY, IF I REALLY TRY I CAN REALLY FLY A KITE! (Off-stage, the kite crashes to the ground Scene 6 - Valentines Sally: Dear Ann Flanders. Last year I sent out 52 valentines and received 75. This year I sent out 58 valentines, but only received 61. Am I right in blaming this on the zip code? CHARLIE BROWN: This is for you Lucy, Happy Valentine's Day. That doesn't sound right. Here, Lucy, this is for you, Happy Valentine's Day. You can do it if you just don't get nervous. This is for you, Lucy, Happy Valentine's Day. (Lucy enters.) Okay, take it easy, you can do it. This is for you Lucy...(He hands her the card) Merry Christmas. (He screams.) GIRL: (Walking across the stage, carrying a lot of valentines. She passes Charlie Brown and drops a valentine on the ground). Hi Charlie Brown. CHARLIE BROWN: Hi... oh wait a minute you dropped something. Say, what is all this? GIRL: Valentines. They’re for all the boys in our class at school that I like. CHARLIE BROWN: Well we wouldn’t want to lose this one, would we? with the initials C. B. on it. GIRL: No I guess not. Craig Bowerman would be very disappointed. (she walks away). CHARLIE BROWN: I'd give anything if that little red haired girl sent me a valentine. Maybe she did send me one... maybe she sent me a valentine and it's in our mailbox right now. I'm afraid to look... If I look and there's nothing there I'll be crushed... but, if she did send me a valentine... I've got to look! (He sticks his head in the mailbox.) HELLOOOOOOOO (It echoes.) Nothing echoes like an empty mailbox. SALLY: I've been thinking about why you didn't get any valentines big brother. I think I figured it out. You didn't get any valentines because no one sent you any. (She laughs.) CHARLIE BROWN: I can't stand it. Look at them laughing and enjoying themselves with their valentines. I sent a valentine to everyone I know this Valentine's Day, and did I get any in return? No, not one. I did not get one single valentine. Everybody gets valentines but me. Nobody likes me. I get about as many valentines as a dog. (SNOOPY walks in with a big bunch of valentines and laughs at Charlie Brown.) My stomach hurts. (He goes over to Lucy's psychiatrist booth.) CHARLIE BROWN: Oh, Lucy, I'm so depressed. Everything is going wrong. I don't know what to do. LUCY: I'm sorry to hear that, Charlie Brown. Maybe there's something I can do to help. I think what you need most of all is to come right out and admit all the things that are wrong with you. CHARLIE BROWN: You really think that will help, Lucy? LUCY: Certainly. CHARLIE BROWN: Alright, I'll try! SONG: THE DOCTOR IS IN CHARLIE BROWN: I'M NOT VERY HANDSOME, OR CLEVER, OR LUCID I'VE ALWAYS BEEN STUPID AT SPELLING AND NUMBERS. I'VE NEVER BEEN MUCH PLAYING FOOTBALL OR BASEBALL, OR STICKBALL OR CHECKERS OR MARBLES OR PING PONG. . . I'M USUALLY AWFUL AT PARTIES AND DANCES I STAND LIKE A STICK, OR I COUGH OR I LAUGH OR I DON'T BRING A PRESENT OR I SPILL THE ICE CREAM OR I GET SO DEPRESSED THAT I STAND AND I SCREAM. . . OH, HOW COULD THERE POSSIBLY BE ONE SMALL PERSON AS THOROUGHLY, TOTALLY, UTTERLY, BLAH AS ME? LUCY: Well, that's okay for a starter. CHARLIE BROWN: A starter? LUCY: Well, sure. . . You don't think that mentioning these few superficial failings is going to do any good, do you? Why, Charlie Brown, you really have to delve! YOU'RE STUPID, SELF-CENTERED AND MOODY. CHARLIE BROWN: I'M MOODY. LUCY: YOU'RE TERRIBLY DULL TO BE WITH. CHARLIE BROWN: YES, I AM. . . AND NOBODY LIKES ME. . . NOT FRIEDA, OR SHERMY, OR LINUS, OR SCHROEDER... LUCY: OR LUCY. CHARLIE BROWN: OR LUCY. LUCY: OR SNOOPY. CHARLIE BROWN: OR SNOOP -- Now wait a minute!! Snoopy likes me. LUCY: He only pretends to like you because you feed him. That doesn't count. CHARLIE BROWN: OR SNOOPY. OH, WHY WAS I BORN JUST TO BE ONE SMALL PERSON AS THOROUGHLY, TOTALLY, UTTERLY... LUCY: Wait!! YOU'RE NOT VERY MUCH OF A PERSON. CHARLIE BROWN: THAT'S CERTAIN. LUCY: AND YET THERE IS REASON FOR HOPE. CHARLIE BROWN: THERE'S HOPE? LUCY: FOR ALTHOUGH YOU ARE NO GOOD AT MUSIC, LIKE SCHROEDER OR HAPPY, LIKE SNOOPY OR LOVELY, LIKE ME!! YOU HAVE THE DISTINCTION TO BE NO ONE ELSE BUT THE SINGULAR, REMARKABLE, UNIQUE CHARLIE BROWN.. . . CHARLIE BROWN: I'M ME! LUCY: YES. . . IT'S AMAZINGLY TRUE. FOR WHAT EVER IT'S WORTH, CHARLIE BROWN, YOU'RE YOU. CHARLIE BROWN: Gosh, Lucy, you know something, I'm beginning to feel better already. You're a true friend, Lucy, a true friend. LUCY: That'll be five cents, please. Scene 7 - Great Thinkers SALLY: I couldn't decide if I wanted fudge marble, chocolate, rocky road, or vanilla. I finally decided on fudge marble. Then I had to choose between a plain cone or a sugar cone. I choose the sugar cone. SO what happened? I walk out and drop the whole thing on the sidewalk. Don't tell me my life isn't a Shakespearean tragedy. LINUS: Today is my grandfather's Birthday, Charlie Brown. CHARLIE BROWN: How old is he? LINUS: 63... It's hard to believe he was once a human being. SNOOPY: Why is it I always have my supper in the red dish and my drinking water in the yellow dish? One of these days I'm going to have my supper in the yellow dish and my drinking water in the red dish. Life's just TOO short not to live it up a little. LUCY: Schroeder, do piano players make a lot of money? SCHROEDER: Money? Who cares about money? This is art you blockhead. This is great music I'm playing and playing great music is an art. DO you hear me? An ART! ART! ART! ART! ART! LUCY: You fascinate me. What? What? WHAAAAT?? BEETHOVEN DAY SCHROEDER: CALL THE PRINCIPAL AND HAND HIM THE NEWS. WE GOT A HOLIDAY THAT HE CAN'T REFUSE. A DAY OF HARMONY AND DAY OF MUSIC. BEETHOVEN'S BIRTHDAY. SALLY: BEETHOVEN DAY? SCHROEDER: A REVERENTIAL MISSION LINUS: BEETHOVEN DAY? SCHROEDER: THE HOPE OF EACH MUSICIAN. NO MORE AM I THE ONLY GUY TO STAND UP AND SAY HOORAY! BEETHOVEN HOORAY ! CHARLIE BROWN: Beethoven Day? LINUS: Yes. As in, Ludwig Von Beethoven, composer. Born 1770 died 1827. The eldest of three sons, Ludwig's mother was the daughter of the chief overseer of the kitchen... LUCY: Whatever!! Schroeder, I just want you to know I'm on your side. I want to help you publicity wise with Beethoven's birthday. After all, this is a really big thing. SCHROEDER: Thanks for your support, but I just don't want to see Beethoven birthday commercialized. LUCY: Commercialized? SCHROEDER: Yes, the next thing you know, they'll be selling Beethoven sweatshirts! SNOOPY: (w/ a Beethoven shirt on) BEETHOVEN DAY! SCHROEDER: IF YOU'RE WONDERING NOW HOW DO WE START. JUST BLOW THE MUSIC TILL YOU KNOW IT BY HEART. WE'RE GONNA CELEBRATE. WE'LL THROW A PARTY. BEETHOVEN'S BIRTHDAY ALL: BEETHOVEN DAY SCHROEDER: AND WHEN YOU SAY THE TITLE. ALL: BEETHOVEN DAY SCHROEDER: YOU HEAR A GREAT RECITAL.

Scene 8 - Homework (Sally appears at Snoopy's doghouse and blows a horn. Snoopy screams.) SALLY: Alright, everybody out for rabbit chasing. SNOOPY: Oh good grief. (She blows a horn again and Snoopy screams again.) SALLY: Come on Snoopy. Up and attum! It's a magnificent day for chasing rabbits. The air is clear, the sun is shining, the fields and woodlands lie open and inviting. SNOOPY: If it's such a magnificent day why spoil it for the rabbits? (She blows the horn.) SALLY: Come on Snoopy. Where's that old thrill of the chase? Where's your spirit of adventure? What kind of dog are you anyway? SNOOPY: I'm a sleeping dog... you take it from there. SALLY: You should be ashamed of yourself, wasting a perfectly good day like this. The scent is fresh, The trail is clear. Let's get out there and track us down a big ol'rabbit. SNOOPY: Well, I get the feeling she's determined. Okay, if that's what she wants, she might as well get her money's worth. SALLY: Atta boy Snoopy, We oughtta see lots of game today. (Sally and Snoopy chase the bunnies) CHARLIE BROWN: Sometimes when you're depressed, all you want to do is nothing. All you want to do is lean your head on you arm and stare into space. Sometimes this can go on for hours. If you’re unusually depressed you may have to change arms. (Sally and Snoopy come back on to the Mission Impossible music) SALLY: Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! SNOOPY: Ro, ro, ro, ro, ro, ro, ro! SALLY: Look out... Look out... LUCY: Schroeder, what did you do with that picture I gave you? SCHROEDER: I threw it away. LUCY: With your own hands? SCHROEDER Of course. LUCY: He touched my picture. (Sally and Snoopy come on again and dance to the Hawaii 5-0 music) CHARLIE BROWN: This has been a bad time for me. Maybe if I'm lucky, tomorrow will be a better day. LINUS: In some parts of the world tomorrow is already today, and today is yesterday. If tomorrow is already today Charlie Brown, there's no way that tomorrow could be a better day. CHARLIE BROWN: You're a lot of fun to have around. BOOK REPORT SALLY AND SNOOPY: CHASING RABBITS, CHASING RABBITS, CHASING RABBITS, CHASING RABBITS, CHASING RABBITS, CHASING RABBITS, CHASING RABBITS, CHASING RABBITS.... LINUS: Rabbits!

SINGER: THE NAME OF THE BOOK ABOUT WHICH, THIS BOOK REPORT IS ABOUT IS, PETER RABBIT, WHICH IS ABOUT THIS RABBIT. I FOUND IT VERY... I LIKED THE PART WHERE... IT WAS A... IT REMINDED ME OF ROBIN HOOD. AND THE PART WHERE LITTLE JOHN JUMPED FROM THE ROCK TO THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM'S BACK. AND THEN ROBIN AND EVERYONE SWUNG FROM THE TREES IN A SUDDEN SURPRISE ATTACK. AND THEY CAPTURED THE SHERIFF AND ALL OF HIS GOODS, AND THEY CARRIED HIM BACK TO THEIR CAMP IN THE WOODS, AND THE SHERIFF WAS GUEST AT THEIR DINNER AND ALL, BUT HE WRIGGLED AWAY AND HE SOUNDED THE CALL AND HIS MEN RUSHED IN AND THE ARROWS FLEW PETER RABBIT DID SORT OF THAT KIND OF THING TOO. LUCY: THE OTHER PEOPLE'S NAME WAS MACGREGOR. Eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three. Hmmm. LINUS: In examining a work such as Peter Rabbit, it is important that the superficial characteristics of its deceptively simple plot should not be allowed to blind the reader to the more substantial fabric of its deeper motivations. In this report, I plan to discuss the sociological implications of family pressures so great as to drive an otherwise moral rabbit to perform acts of thievery which he consciously knew were against the law. I also hope to explore the personality of Mr. MacGregor in his conflicting roles as farmer and humanitarian. Peter Rabbit is established from the start as a benevolent hero. . . CHARLIE BROWN: IF I START WRITING NOW WHEN I'M NOT REALLY RESTED IT COULD UPSET MY THINKING WHICH IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. I'LL GET A FRESH START TOMORROW AND IT'S NOT DUE TILL WEDNESDAY, SO I'LL HAVE ALL OF TUESDAY, UNLESS SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN. WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN I SHOULD BE OUTSIDE PLAYING, GETTING FRESH AIR AND SUNSHINE, I WORK BEST UNDER PRESSURE AND THERE'LL BE LOTS OF PRESSURE IF I WAIT TILL TOMORROW, I SHOULD START WRITING NOW. BUT IF I START WRITING NOW WHEN I'M NOT REALLY RESTED, IT COULD UPSET MY THINKING WHICH IS NO GOOD AT ALL. LUCY: THE NAME OF THE RABBIT WAS PETER. Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, Thirty. Yes!! SINGER: DOWN CAME THE STAFF ON HIS HEAD SMASH! AND ROBIN FELL LIKE A SACK FULL OF LEAD CRASH!

IT WAS THE SIGN FOR THE FIGHT TO BEGIN ZING! AND THEN IT LOOKED LIKE THE SHERIFF WOULD WIN AH! BUT NOT FOR LONG. AWAY THEY RAN. JUST LIKE RABBITS, WHO RUN A LOT, AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE STORY OF PETER RABBIT. WHICH THIS REPORT IS ABOUT. SALLY AND SNOOPY: (Running across the stage singing) RABBITS RABBITS RABBITS RABBITS CHASING RABBITS CHARLIE BROWN: (who is by this time a mess from all the tension) HOW DO THEY EXPECT US TO WRITE A BOOK REPORT . . . LUCY: THERE WERE VEGETABLES IN THE GARDEN.... CHARLIE BROWN: ...OF ANY QUALITY IN JUST TWO DAYS. LUCY: SUCH AS CARROTS AND SPINACH AND ONIONS CHARLIE BROWN: HOW CAN THEY CONSPIRE TO MAKE LIFE SO MISERABLE AND SO EFFECTIVELY IN SO MANY WAYS. LUCY: AND LETTUCE AND TURNIPS AND PARSLEY AND OKRA AND CABBAGE AND STRING BEANS AND PARSNIPS TOMATOES, POTATOES, ASPARAGUS CAULIFLOWER, RHUBARB, AND CHIVES.. LINUS: Not to mention the extreme pressure exerted on him by his deeply rooted rivalry with Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail!!!

Seventy-five, seventy-six, Seventy-seven, seventy-eight, Seventy-nine, Eighty Eighty-one, Eighty-two.

SINGER: PETER RABBIT WAS A LOT LIKE ROBIN HOOD PETER RABBIT WAS A LOT LIKE ROBIN HOOD..... LINUS: SOCIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS JOINED WITH FAMILIAL CONDEMNATIONS.... LUCY: PETER RABBIT (8 times).... SALLY AND SNOOPY: RABBIT (4 times).... ALL: RABBIT (7 times).... CHARLIE BROWN: I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET! ALL: PETER RABBIT! Act 2 scene 1 - snoopy’s imagination SNOOPY: Here's the World War One flying ace high over France in his Sopwith Camel, searching for the infamous Red Baron. I must bring him down. Suddenly anti-aircraft fire, archie we used to call it, begins to burst beneath my plane. The Red Baron has spotted me. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, you can't hit me! Actually, tough flying aces never say "nah nah"... I was just... drat this fog. It's bad enough to have to fight the Red Baron then to have to fly in weather like this. Alright Red Baron! Where are you? You can't hide from me forever, (Offstage voices sing Ah.) Ah, the sun has broken through. I can see the woods of Montsec below.... ça va, bonjour! But, what's that? It's a Fokker triplane. Ha, I've got you this time, Red Baron. (He make machine gun noises: rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat- tat) Augh! He's diving down out of the sun. He's tricked me again. I've got to run. Come on Sopwith Camel, let's go. Go, Camel, go! GO! (Snoopy sings the Ah.) I can't shake him. He's riddling my plane with bullets. Curse you red Baron! Curse you and your kind. Curse the evil that causes all this unhappiness. Here's the World War One flying ace back at the aerodrome in France. He is exhausted and yet he does not sleep, for one thought continues to burn in his mind: Someday, someday I'll get you Red Baron. scene 2 - a little later MY NEW PHILOSOPHY SALLY: Oh yeah? That's what you think! Oh yeah? That's what you think! Oh yeah? That's what you think! Oh yeah?!? That's what you think! SCHROEDER: What? SALLY: That's my new philosophy: Oh yeah? That's what you think! SCHROEDER: Well, why are you telling me? SALLY: Huh? SCHROEDER: Why are you telling me? SALLY: Why are you telling me? I like it! That's a good philosophy! Why are you telling me? Why are you telling me? Why are you telling me? WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME? MY NEW PHILOSOPHY. THE TEACHER GAVE A 'D' ON LAST WEEK'S HOMEWORK. SHE SAID, "MISS SALLY BROWN," "YOUR GRADES ARE GOING DOWN." I COULD HAVE TOLD HER SCHROEDER: YOUR NEW PHILOSOPHY. SALLY: MY NEW PHILOSOPHY. ”Miss B.?" "I'm she." "Look, see?" "A 'D'?" "A 'D'." "Well, why are you telling me?" AND THAT'S MY NEW PHILOSOPHY. SCHROEDER: That's your new philosophy? SALLY: Why are you telling me? MY NEW PHILOSOPHY. SCHROEDER: That's great, Sally, but I have to go practice Chopin's "Nocturne in B-flat Minor." SALLY: No! I like it! No! That's a good philosophy. No! No! No! SCHROEDER: That's your new philosophy, huh? SALLY: Yes! -- I mean no! JUST LIKE A BUSY BEE EACH NEW PHILOSOPHY CAN FLY FROM TREE TO TREE AND KEEP ME MOVING. WHEN LIFE'S A DIZZY MAZE ON ALTERNATING DAYS I CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PHRASE. SCHROEDER: YOUR NEW PHILOSOPHY. SALLY: MY NEW PHILOSOPHY. SCHROEDER: SALLY, SOME PHILOSOPHIES ARE SIMPLE. . . Man cannot live by breadalone. SOME PHILOSOPHIES ARE CLEAR. SALLY: Leave your message at the sound of the tone. . .? BOTH: SOME PHILOSOPHIES PICK AND CHOOSE DECIDING WHAT GOES IN IT. SCHROEDER: SOME TAKE A LIFETIME -- SALLY: MINE TAKE A MINUTE. SCHROEDER: Sally, anything that takes only a minute can't be very lasting. For instance, Beethoven took over two years to complete his brilliant "9th Symphony." SALLY: No! SCHROEDER: I can't stand it!! (he storms off) SALLY: I can't stand it – I like it! IT'S LIKE A GUARANTEE MY NEW PHILOSOPHY AND THINGS ARE SURE TO BE A WHOLE LOT BRIGHTER. "Oh yeah... That's what you think... Why are you telling me?... NO... I can't stand it." NOW LIFE IS FREE AND EASY. MUCH MORE PHILOSOPH-EASY WITH MY BRAND NEW... LUCY: (She runs across the stage in a panic, shrieking) Ahhhh! This is the last day! I only have twenty-four hours left! Help me! Help me! This is the last day! Ahhhh! SALLY: Clearly, some philosophies are not for all people. AND THAT'S MY NEW PHILOSOPHY! Scene 3 - Baseball Game CHARLIE BROWN: All right, gang. I want this game to be our biggest and best game of the season, and I want everyone out there playing with everything he's got... LUCY: Charlie Brown, I thought up some new strategy for you. Why don't you tell the other team that we're going to play them at a certain place, only it isn't the real place, and then when they don't show up, we'll win by forfeit. Isn't that good strategy? I don't understand these managers who don't want to use good strategy. CHARLIE BROWN: The thing we have to remember is spirit and teamwork. If we all really grit our teeth and bear down SCHROEDER: That other team was trash talkin' us Charlie Brown. I got even with them though. I said you think your so great? Mozart was writing symphonies when he was your age. That really shut 'em up. CHARLIE BROWN: I bet it did. If we really grit our teeth and bear down I'm sure we could finish the season... LINUS: Perhaps you shouldn't be a playing manager Charlie Brown. Perhaps you should be a bench manager. SALLY: That's a good idea. You'd be a great bench manager big brother. You could say "Bench do this" or "Bench do that." You could even be in charge of where we put the bench. When we get to the playing field. you could say, "Let's put the bench here" or "Let's put the bench there." CHARLIE BROWN: I can't stand it! LUCY: What's the point of our playing when we know we're going to lose? If there was even a million-to-one chance we might win, it would make some sense. CHARLIE BROWN: Well, there may not be a million -to-one chance, but I'm sure there's at least a billion-to-one chance. TEAM CHARLIE BROWN: Come on, gimme a "T." ALL: "T" CHARLIE BROWN: Gimme an "E" ALL: "E" CHARLIE BROWN: Gimme an "A" ALL: "A" CHARLIE BROWN: Gimme a "M" ALL: "M" CHARLIE BROWN: What's that spell? (all are confused) CHARLIE BROWN: Team! ALL: Team! THERE IS NO TEAM LIKE THE BEST TEAM, WHICH IS OUR TEAM RIGHT HERE. WE WILL SHOW YOU WE'RE THE BEST TEAM IN THE VERY LITTLE LEAGUE THIS YEAR. AND IN NO TIME WE'LL BE BIG TIME, WITH THE BIG LEAGUE BASEBALL STARS, FOR ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WIN JUST ONE MORE GAME AND THE CHAMPIONSHIP IS OURS. CHARLIE BROWN: Dear Pen Pal, YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED TODAY AT THE BASEBALL GAME IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TODAY AT THE BASEBALL GAME I WAS THE MANAGER, SCHROEDER WAS CATCHER, AND ALL OF THE TEAM WAS THE SAME AS ALWAYS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER DISASTER STRUCK AT THE BASEBALL GAME. Huddle up! ALL: Break!! LUCY: I got it! LINUS: I got it! SCHROEDER: I got it! SNOOPY: Woof woof woof (which sounds like I got it)! SALLY: AAHHH (she screams) LUCY: (to Charlie Brown) I thought you had it! CHARLIE BROWN: THREE BALLS, TWO STRIKES, THE BASES WERE LOADED WITH TWO MEN OUT. I PITCHED MY CURVE, BUT SOMEHOW HE HIT IT A GOOD STRONG CLOUT. "LUCY," I HOLLERED, "IT'S COMIN' RIGHT TO YA." SHE CAUGHT IT AS EASY AS PIE -- THEN DROPPED IT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR A TEAM'S MORALE TO SEE THEIR MANAGER CRY. SNOOPY HELPED OUT BY BITING A RUNNER AND CATCHING THE BALL IN HIS TEETH. LINUS CAUGHT FLIES FROM A THIRD-STORY WINDOW BY HOLDING HIS BLANKET BENEATH. YES, WE HAD FORTITUDE, NO ONE COULD ARGUE WITH THAT. AND ONE RUN WOULD WIN US THE GAME AS I CAME UP TO BAT. OTHERS: GO CHARLIE BROWN, CHARLIE BROWN, CHARLIE BROWN LUCY: All right, Charlie Brown, we're all behind you -- sort of. I mean this man can't pitch, he pitches like my grandmother, Charlie Brown! Now, all you have to do bear down -- just bear down. Listen, when you get to first, watch me for my signal -- got it Flash? OTHERS (quietly in the background): THERE IS NOT TEAM LIKE THE BEST TEAM, WHICH IS OUR TEAM RIGHT HERE. WE WILL SHOW YOU WE'RE THE BEST TEAM IN THE VERY LITTLE LEAGUE THIS YEAR. AND IN NO TIME WE'LL BE BIG TIME, WITH THE BIG LEAGUE BASEBALL STARS, ALL: FOR ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS WIN JUST ONE MORE GAME. LUCY And the championship is ours! OTHERS: (whispering) Ours, Ours, Ours. CHARLIE BROWN: TWO MEN WERE ON WITH TWO OUTS AND ME WITH ONE STRIKE TO GO. OTHERS (whispering): One strike... One strike... CHARLIE BROWN: THEN I SAW HER, THIS CUTE LITTLE REDHEADED GIRL I KNOW. FIRMLY I VOWED I WOULD WIN IT FOR HER AND I SHOULDERED THE BAT AND I SWUNG. . . ALL: Awwwww! CHARLIE BROWN: DEAR PEN PAL, I'M TOLD WHERE YOU LIVE IS REALLY QUITE FAR. WOULD YOU PLEASE SEND DIRECTIONS ON HOW I CAN GET WHERE YOU ARE? YOUR FRIEND, CHARLIE BROWN. scene 4 - crabbiness survey SCHROEDER: I'm sorry to have to say it right to your face, Lucy, but it's true. You're a very crabby person. I know your crabbiness has probably become so natural to you that you're not even aware when you're being crabby, but it's true just the same. You're a very crabby person and you're crabby to just about everyone you meet. Now I hope you don't mind my saying this, Lucy, and I hope you'll take it in the spirit that it's intended. I think we should all be open to any opportunity to learn more about ourselves. I think Socrates was very right when he said that one of the first rules for anyone in life is "Know thyself." Well, I guess I've said about enough. I hope I haven't offended you or anything. LUCY: Well, what's Socrates got to do with it anyway, huh? Who was SHE anyway? Did she ever get to be queen, huh! Tell me that, did she ever get to be queen! DID she ever get to be queen? Who WAS Socrates, anyway? "Know thyself," hmph! CHARLIE BROWN: Hey, Snoopy, you want to help me get my arm back in shape? Now, watch out for this one, it's a new fast ball. LUCY: Excuse me a moment, Charlie Brown, but I was wondering if you'd mind answering a few questions. CHARLIE BROWN: Certainly, Lucy. LUCY: Well, I'm conducting a survey to enable me to know myself better, and first of all I'd like to ask: on a scale of zero to one hundred, using a standard of fifty as average, seventy-five as above average and ninety as exceptional, where would you rate me with regards to crabbiness? CHARLIE BROWN: Well, Lucy, I... LUCY: Your ballots need not be signed and all answers will be held in strictest confidence. CHARLIE BROWN: Well, still, Lucy, that's a very difficult question to answer. LUCY: You may have a few moments to think it over if you want, or we can come back to that question later. CHARLIE BROWN: I think I'd like to come back to it, if you don't mind. LUCY: Certainly. This next question deals with certain character traits you may have observed. Regarding personality, would you say that mine is A forceful, B pleasing, or C objectionable? Would that be A,B, or C? What would your answer be to that, Charlie Brown, A,B, or C, which one would you say, hmm? Charlie Brown, hmm? CHARLIE BROWN: Well, I guess I'd have to say forceful, Lucy, but... LUCY: "Forceful." Well, we'll make a check mark at the letter A then. Now, would you rate my ability to get along with other people as poor, fair, good, or excellent? CHARLIE BROWN: I think that depends a lot on what you mean by "get along with other people." LUCY: You know, make friends, sparkle in a crowd, that sort of thing. CHARLIE BROWN Do you have a place for abstention? LUCY: Certainly, I'll just put a check mark at "None of the above." The next question deals with physical appearance. In referring to my beauty, would you say that I was "stunning," "mysterious," or "intoxicating"? CHARLIE BROWN: Well, gee, I don't know, Lucy. You look just fine to me. LUCY: "Stunning." All right, Charlie Brown, I think we should get back to that first question. On a scale of zero to one hundred, using a standard of fifty as average, seventy-five as... CHARLIE BROWN: I... remember the question Lucy. LUCY: Well? CHARLIE BROWN: Fifty-one? LUCY: Fifty-one is your crabbiness rating for me. Well that about does it. Thank you very much for helping with this survey, Charlie Brown. Your cooperation has been greatly appreciated. CHARLIE BROWN: It was a pleasure Lucy, any time. Come on Snoopy. LUCY: Oh, just a minute, there is one more question. Would you answer "Yes" or "No" to the question: "Is Lucy Van Pelt the sort of person that you would like to have as president of your club or civic organization?" CHARLIE BROWN: Oh, yes, by all means, Lucy. LUCY: Yes. Well thank you very much. That about does it, I think. (Charlie Brown and Snoopy begin to leave. Snoopy stops and make the sound of a bomb dropping and blowing up.) WELL, WHO ASKED YOU! Now let's see. That's a fifty-one, "None of the above," and... Schroeder was right. I can already feel myself being filled with the glow of self-awarness. (SALLY enters.) Oh Sally, I'm conducting a survey and I wonder if... SALLY: A hundred and ten, C, "Poor," "None of the above," "No," and what are you going to do about the dent you made in my bicycle! (Sally storms off.) LUCY: It's amazing how fast word of these surveys gets around. (Linus enters.) Oh Linus, I'm glad you're here. I'm conducting a survey and there are a few questions I'd like to ask you. LINUS: Sure, go ahead. LUCY: The first question is: on a scale of zero to one hundred, with a standard of fifty as average, seventy-five as above average and ninety as exceptional, where would you rate me with regards to crabbiness? LINUS: (He laughs.) You're my big sister. LUCY: That's not the question. LINUS: No, but that's the answer. LUCY: Come on, Linus, answer the question. LINUS: Look, Lucy, I know very well that if I give any sort of honest answer to that question you're going to slug me. LUCY: Linus. A survey that is not based on honest answers is like a house that is built on a foundation of sand. Would I be spending my time to conduct this survey if I didn't expect complete candor in all the responses? I promise not to slug you. Now what number would you give me as your crabbiness rating? LINUS: Ninety-five. (She punches him very hard.) LUCY: NO decent person could be expected to keep her word with a rating over ninety. Now, I add these two columns and that gives me my answer. There, it's all done. Now, let's see what we've got. It's true. I'm a crabby person. I'm a very crabby person and everybody knows it. I've been spreading crabbiness wherever I go. I'm a super crab. It's a wonder anyone will still talk to me. It's a wonder I have any friends at all... or even associates. I've done nothing but make life miserable for everyone. I've done nothing but breed unhappiness and resentment. Where did I go wrong? How could I be so selfish? How could... LINUS What's wrong, Lucy? LUCY: Don't talk to me, Linus. I don't deserve to be spoken to. I don't deserve to breathe the air I breathe. I'm no good, Linus. I'm no good. LINUS: That's not true. LUCY: Yes it is. I'm no good, and there's no reason at all why I should go on living on the face of this earth. LINUS: Yes there is. LUCY: Name one. Just tell me one single reason why I should still deserve to go on living on this planet. LINUS: Well, for one thing, you have a little brother who loves you. (Lucy is silent for a minute and then burst into tears) Every now and then I say the right thing. Scene 5 - Glee Club Rehearsal GLEE CLUB REHEARSAL SCHROEDER: Of course it's surprising, but I'm sure Lucy knows now that she can't be crabby anymore. SALLY: (who is echoing Schroeder) Anymore. SCHROEDER: Where is everybody? I told them to be here. SALLY: Told them to be here. SCHROEDER: If we don't rehearse we can't sing at the assembly tomorrow. SALLY: assembly tomorrow. SCHROEDER: Charlie Brown! SALLY: Charlie Brown! SCHROEDER: Linus! SALLY: Linus! SCHROEDER and SALLY: Lucy! LUCY: Give me back my pencil, you blockhead!! LINUS: No! Not until you give me back my crayons! LUCY: That is my best pencil! If you don't give me back my pencil, I'll tell Sally what you said about her! SCHROEDER: Stop that! We gotta rehearse! You're late! SALLY: What did you say about me, Linus? LUCY: He said -- LINUS: Lucy. . . SCHROEDER: Stop that! CHARLIE BROWN: Sorry , I'm late -- SCHROEDER: There is no time to be sorry! SALLY: What did he say ? SCHROEDER: Quiet!! Now remember this is a mood piece, we must paint a picture with music and words... and concentrate! (he blows the pitch pipe) ALL: AHHHH SCHROEDER: Remember. . . adagio con brio! ALL: OH GIVE ME A HOME WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM AND THE DEER AND THE ANTELOPE PLAY. . . LUCY: GIVE ME MY PENCIL ALL: WHERE SELDOM IS HEARD A DISCOURAGING WORD LINUS: NOT ON YOUR LIFE ALL: AND THE SKIES ARE NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY. SALLY: IF YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT YOU TOLD LUCY I'M JUST GOING TO SCREAM LUCY: GIVE ME MY PENCIL YOU BLOCKHEAD!! ALL: HOME, HOME ON THE RANGE. LUCY: GIVE ME MY PENCIL LINUS: No! ALL: WHERE THE DEER AND THE ANTELOPE PLAY. WHERE SELDOM IS HEARD A DISCOURAGING WORD LINUS: NOT UNTIL YOU PROMISE NOT TO TELL HER LUCY: WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO? STIFLE MY FREEDOM OF SPEECH? ALL: WHERE SELDOM IS HEARD LUCY: GIVE ME MY PENCIL! ALL: A DISCOURAGING WORD LINUS: NO PROMISE NO PENCIL! ALL: AND THE SKIES ARE NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY. SALLY: (Lucy slips Sally the pencil, and Sally holds it up, teasing Linus) What pencil? (she laughs) LINUS: (Linus grabs the pencil.) No! Give me that pencil!! ALL: OH, GIVE ME A LAND WHERE THE BRIGHT DIAMOND SAND SCHROEDER: Sing!!! ALL: FLOWS LEISURELY DOWN THE STREAM CHARLIE BROWN (to Linus): Why did you take Sally's pencil? LINUS: Aaaaaarrrrrrggg !! (he storms off) ALL: THERE THE GRACEFUL, WHITE SWAN GOES GLIDING ALONG SALLY (to Lucy): WHAT DID HE CALL ME? ALL: LIKE A MAID IN A HEAVENLY DREAM. LUCY: HE SAID HE SAID YOU WERE... AN ENIGMA! ALL: HOME, HOME ON THE RANGE SALLY: An enigma? CHARLIE BROWN : An enigma? SNOOPY: An enigma? SALLY: BOY THAT MAKES ME... WHAT A TERRIBLE THING TO CALL A... WHAT'S AN ENIGMA? Never mind!! (she storms off too) ALL: WHERE THE DEER AND THE LUCY: What's an enigma? ALL: ANTELOPE CHARLIE BROWN: What's an enigma? ALL: PLAY. SNOOPY: What's an en . . . LUCY: Hey !! He's still got my pencil! (now she storms off) CHARLIE BROWN AND SCHROEDER: WHERE SELDOM IS HEARD A DISCOURAGING WORD... (seeing he's the only one left, Charlie Brown sneaks away) SCHROEDER: AND THE SKIES ARE NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY! (He turns around and sees only Snoopy is still there) SNOOPY: Arrro ooo ooo . . . (Snoopy gives Schroeder a big smirk and throws him a kiss, and finally Schroeder storms off) scene 6 - Little Known Facts SALLY: Each family has a chain of command. And do you know who is the lowest on that chain? Guess? It's the dog... the dog's the lowest on that chain. Do you understand? I said do you understand that? (Long moment of silence follows) SNOOPY: They hate it when you just stare at them like this. CHARLIE BROWN: Hi, Linus. Where are you going? LINUS: Lucy’s teaching me, Charlie Brown. She says a sister is responsible for the education of her little brother, so she's teaching me. Boy, is she intelligent. LUCY: Come along Linus. LITTLE KNOWN FACTS LUCY: DO YOU SEE THIS TREE? IT IS A FIR TREE. IT'S CALLED A FIR TREE BECAUSE IT GIVES US FUR FOR COATS. IT ALSO GIVES US WOOL IN THE WINTER TIME. LINUS: I never knew that before, Lucy. That's very interesting. LUCY: THIS IS AN ELM TREE. IT'S VERY LITTLE BUT IT WILL GROW UP INTO A GIANT TREE... AN OAK. YOU CAN TELL HOW OLD IT IS BY COUNTING IT'S LEAVES. LINUS Gosh Lucy, that's fascinating. CHARLIE BROWN: Now wait a minute Lucy! I don't mean to interfere, but... LUCY: AND WAY UP THERE THOSE FLUFFY LITTLE WHITE THINGS, THOSE ARE CLOUDS, THEY MAKE THE WIND BLOW. AND WAY DOWN THERE, THOSE TINY LITTLE BLACK THINGS... THOSE ARE BUGS THEY MAKE THE GRASS GROW. LINUS: Is that so? LUCY: That's right! They run around all day, tugging and tugging on each tiny seedling until it grows into a great tall blade of grass! LINUS: Boy, that's amazing! CHARLIE BROWN: Oh, good grief! LUCY: AND THIS THING HERE, IT'S CALLED A HYDRANT. THEY GROW ALL OVER AND NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW JUST HOW A LITTLE THING LIKE THAT GETS SO MUCH WATER. SEE THAT BIRD? IT'S CALLED AN EAGLE. SINCE IT'S LITTLE IT HAS ANOTHER NAME, A SPARROW. AND ON CHRISTMAS AND THANKSGIVING WE EAT THEM. CHARLIE BROWN: Lucy, how could you say that? I'm sorry but I can't stand idly by and listen to... LUCY: AND WAY UP THERE, THE LITTLE STARS AND PLANETS MAKE THE RAIN THAT OFTEN SHOWERS. AND WHEN IT'S COLD AND WINTER IS UPON US THE SNOW COMES UP! JUST LIKE THE FLOWERS. CHARLIE BROWN: Now Lucy, I know that's wrong! Snow doesn't come up, it comes down!! LUCY: After it comes up, the wind blows it around so it looks like it's coming down, but actually it comes up out of the ground, just like grass. It comes up, Charlie Brown, snow comes up! CHARLIE BROWN: Oh, Good Grief! (He exits, from off stage there is a hollow thumping sound.) LINUS: Why is Charlie Brown banging his head against that tree? LUCY: To loosen the bark to make the tree grow faster! CLOUDS CAN MAKE THE WIND BLOW BUGS CAN MAKE THE GRASS GROW SO, THERE YOU GO THESE ARE LITTLE KNOWN FACTS THAT NOW YOU KNOW! scene 7 - suppertime SUPPERTIME SNOOPY: My stomach clock just went off. It's suppertime, and Charlie Brown has forgotten to feed me. Here I lie, a withering hollow shell of a dog and there sits my supper dish ... EMPTY! But that's all right. He'll remember. When no furry friend comes to greet him after school, then he'll remember! And he'll rush out here to the doghouse but it'll be too late. There will be nothing left but the dried carcass of his former friend who used to love to run and play so happily with him. Nothing left but the bleached puppy bones of... CHARLIE BROWN: Hey Snoopy!

Scene 8 - Happiness LUCY: Well, I don't know, Linus, it looks like an airplane to me the way the lights are blinking on and off. Schroeder, is that an airplane or a star? SCHROEDER: I believe that is a star. But you know it could be a planet. Or maybe even a satellite. SALLY: It could be a satellite. I wonder. LINUS: Well, we'll never find out by just sitting here. LUCY: Where are you going? LINUS: I'm going over here to get a closer look. SNOOPY: I like to sit up here after supper and listen to the sounds of the night. But somehow something seems to be missing. (He lets out a big howl.) In my opinion, that's exactly what it needed. CHARLIE BROWN: I'm so happy! The little red-haired girl dropped her pencil. It has teeth marks all over it. She nibbles her pencil. She's human! It hasn't been such a bad day after all. HAPPINESS CHARLIE BROWN: HAPPINESS IS FINDING A PENCIL.
