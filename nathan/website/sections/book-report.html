            <h1>Why Buddy should Be In Smash Bros</h1>

            <p>
                I think that, of all the elves in the north pole, Buddy
                would be the best one to be in smash bros. First of all, he could have a move where
                he would be riding the tricycle around and then hit opponents, but that wouldn't have
                to be his only special move. For example, he could get hit by a car and then not be
                hurt, so that could also work for motorcycles, so that would be a good move. Also,
                his <span class="misspelled">nuetral</span> A could be throwing snowballs really fast.
            </p>

            <p>
                Basically, when buddy was 12, he was playing basketball, and Mario was 30 before he did.
                I think Buddy's final smash could be that he would jump onto a tree and then the tree
                could stay in the game and would attack opponents. I think Buddy could team up with
                <span class="misspelled">micheal</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To unlock Buddy, I think you could have to play on the ice climber stage with mario.
                Then when you fight him he would be hard to defeat and would be on the empire
                building. I think buddy could also attack by throwing snowballs when he's jumping.
            </p>

            <p>
                Buddy would move around really fast but he could also get onto the stage by jumping
                onto ice. I don't think Santa could be an assist trophy. I think walter should be an
                assist trophy. For music, a good one to pick would be the song that plays when buddy
                is talking with <span class="misspelled">michel</span>. So basically, I think if they
                put buddy in smash bros that would be a good idea.
