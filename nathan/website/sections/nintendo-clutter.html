                <p>
                    People say music makes a game. <br><br>
                    <em>Metroid II: Return of Samus</em> seemed to disagree. <br><br>
                    The Game Boy’s tiny speaker offered up what can only be described as
                    an extended therapy session between low-frequency hums and shrill beeps
                    that may or may not have been melodies.

                    <li>“Atmospheric,” they said, while slowly losing their sanity in the
                        infinitely looping caves.</li>
                    <li>“Minimalist genius,” posted another, right before admitting they
                        muted it and put on their own playlist.</li>
                    <li>And of course, the classic: “Unsettling in all the right ways —
                        like an alien radio caught between channels.”</li>

                <p style="font-style:italic; margin-top:10px;">
                    In hindsight, maybe it wasn’t music at all. Maybe it was the planet itself, humming.
                    Or maybe the composer just knew the Game Boy’s limits and decided to
                    stick his audio equipment in a microwave.

                <p>
                    The <b>Love Tester</b> was released in <u>1969</u> by Nintendo, created by <b>Gunpei Yokoi</b> 🧑‍🔬 (later the genius
                    behind the <i>Game & Watch</i> and <i>Game Boy</i>).
                    It was one of Nintendo’s <b>first electronic devices</b> ⚡, designed to “measure” the chemistry between two people
                    holding its sensors 👩‍❤️‍👨.
                </p>

                <p><b>✨ Fun Facts:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>🔌 <b>First Nintendo product</b> to use real electronic components.</li>
                    <li>🌎 Marketed in the West as a <i>“Love/Lie Detector”</i>.</li>
                    <li>💵 Originally retailed for <b>¥1,800</b> in Japan (~$5 at the time).</li>
                    <li>📺 Commercials aired on Japanese TV have gained a <i>cult following</i>.</li>
                    <li>💏 Yokoi joked it worked best if you <b>kissed your partner</b> while holding it.</li>
                    <li>🎮 Part of Nintendo’s “<b>Mini Game Series</b>”.</li>

                <p><b>🔬 Why it “worked”:</b></p>
                <p>
                    The device exploited basic <b>bioelectric conductivity</b> ⚡: when two people held the probes,
                    their combined skin resistance completed a circuit. The meter simply displayed how much current flowed —
                    but Nintendo marketed it as a “love score”! 💡

                        Now we’re being told the engine gaskets warp when exposed to fireballs. In the Mushroom Kingdom,

                        will need new inspection protocols. It isn’t glamorous, but broken karts in front of the
                        castle gates are not a good look for the monarchy.”

                        without risk of blowing steam, then mechanics will be flooded with panicked racers.

                        The gasket issue shows they cut corners. A kart should survive a thunder strike
                        and keep rolling. Clearly this one can’t.”

                        My minions have reported the same thing during lava-track tests. A kart that can’t handle
                        a simple dunk in magma has no place in competition.”

                        The Standard Kart M was popular among casual racers. Now entire cups will be delayed
                        because drivers need replacements. It’s going to hit prize pools.”

                        But the issue is frequency. When a kart model fails this often,
                        you spend more time fixing than racing. That’s not acceptable even for skeleton crews.”

                        Now I can’t recommend it. If new drivers stall out in the middle of Rainbow Road,
                        it’s not just frustrating—it’s dangerous. This isn’t what racing should be.”

                <p style="font-family: monospace; line-height: 1.6;">
                    Do you ever wander aimlessly through sprawling towns, searching for that <em>one random NPC</em>
                    who apparently only exists between 2:00 and 3:00 AM on a Tuesday in a back alley you forgot existed?
                </p>

                <pre>
    ┌────────────────────────────┐
    │ Town Map (Simplified)      │
    │                            │
    │  ███ House ███             │
    │          ○ (maybe NPC?)    │
    │     █ Fountain █           │
    │       ○ (not him)          │
    │   █ Market █               │
    │        ○ (still not him)   │
    └────────────────────────────┘
    </pre>

                <p style="font-family: monospace;">
                    NPC spawns are inconsistent. You check everywhere. Nothing. He’s gone.
                    Meanwhile, quest tracker says “Talk to Gerald.” Gerald does not exist.
                </p>

                <h3>The "Secret" Solution:</h3>
                <p style="font-family: monospace;">
                    Instead of endlessly roaming, you simply return to your hometown at night.<br>
                    Stand in the exact spot where your character first noticed the stray dog barking.<br>
                    Wait for the in-game clock to tick past 01:00.<br>
                    Then rotate the camera three full times.<br>
                    At this point, the NPC you seek will be technically <em>loaded</em> into the town you left,
                    but you will not see him. To confirm, you must immediately fast-travel back.<br><br>
                    Congratulations: the NPC is now there. He has always been there.
                </p>

                    This is not efficient. It is not enjoyable. But it is technically a method.
                    So next time you cannot find “Gerald” or whoever, don’t panic.

                <h3>The Search for "Konoke Spider"</h3>

                <p>
                    For nearly four years, I have devoted my life to the systematic compilation of
                    every known piece of music from <em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em>.
                    At first, the task was straightforward. Official tracklists, online repositories,
                    and fan-maintained wikis provided reference points that seemed stable and complete.
                    Yet amidst the larger work, one anomaly emerged: a track named only as
                    <strong>"Konoke Spider"</strong>. Its existence was referenced obliquely in loose
                    conversations, its placement uncertain, its purpose obscured.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase I: Initial Discovery</h3>
                <p>
                    My first encounter with the name came during casual research.
                    It was mentioned not as a discrete entry, but in a
                    footnote, linked to an unverified user contribution from 2020.
                    The description was sparse, and no associated scene, boss battle, or cutscene
                    could be matched. I noted it and assumed clarification would come later.
                    It did not.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase II: Forum Inquiries</h3>
                <p>
                    With the wikis silent, I sought direct testimony. I registered across multiple
                    discussion boards and I began
                    carefully composed threads. Responses came swiftly, but without consensus. One user insisted it played in a
                    hidden dialogue in Autumn Mountain. Another claimed it was an unused boss buildup.
                    Yet another dismissed it as a fan edit mislabeled and spread through early rips.
                    I recorded each claim in a growing dossier. None could be verified.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase III: Retail Inquiry</h3>
                <p>
                    Still unsatisfied, I turned to those who work daily among the physical distribution
                    of games. I spoke with clerks and managers at multiple GameStop locations, asking
                    if they had internal cataloging or promotional discs that might reference the track.
                    The employees were polite but puzzled. Some had not even heard of the game. Others
                    repeated the soundtrack’s official number of pieces, which made no room for
                    “Konoke Spider.” Once more, I left without answers.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase IV: Technical Examination</h3>
                <p>
                    At last, I concluded that only the data itself could reveal the truth. I acquired
                    a modified console and extracted the raw audio files from the game.
                    Each track bore an internal tag—metadata often overlooked in casual rips.
                    There, buried deep within the filesystem, I found a file labeled
                    <code>bgm_spider_konoke_test01.dspadpcm</code>. Its timestamp corresponded not to the
                    release version, but to a development build. The audio itself was brief,
                    thirty-one seconds of...atmospheric noise, ending abruptly
                    as if unfinished.
                </p>

                <h3>Findings</h3>
                <p>
                    Evidence suggests “Konoke Spider” was never implemented in the final sequence of the game.
                    Its file tag implies a test piece, perhaps an early attempt at scoring an unused
                    miniboss room. Chronological placement remains uncertain, though most consistent
                    with the <em>Shogun Studios</em> arc, where arachnid enemies are present but
                    underscored by different compositions.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    While I have not definitively placed “Konoke Spider” within the canonical
                    soundtrack order, my research has confirmed its origin as a genuine but abandoned
                    composition within the game’s data. The journey from simple wiki notes to
                    technical file extraction underscores the fragility of video game music
                    preservation. My search continues—not for recognition, but for the assurance
                    that no track, however small, is lost to silence.

                <p>
                    This program was more than an anti-piracy mechanism. It was an instrument of cultural
                    calibration. Its influence extended beyond games, shaping generations to associate
                    unauthorized access with unease. With this report now unsealed, the evidence is clear:
                    humanity is measurably better for having encountered the Sonic CD Anti-Piracy Screen.

                <h2>❤️ Spousal Interaction in Cozy Farm RPGs</h2>

                <img src="./assets/nintendo-clutter/farming-rpg.png"
                     alt="Farming RPG"
                     style="border: 2px ridge; margin: 5px auto; display:block; max-width:250px;">

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Many farming role-playing games include systems that allow the player to marry an in-game character.
                    This is often positioned as an important mechanic, even though the actual implementation is modest.
                    Once married, the spouse resides in the player’s home, which has limited but technically noticeable effects.
                </p>

                <h3>Benefits of Marriage (Such As They Are)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>👫 The spouse can walk around the farm at the same time you.</li>
                    <li>🪑 You and your spouse may both sit in chairs in the same room, facing either the same direction or different directions.</li>
                    <li>🍳 Occasionally, the spouse might prepare a meal, reducing the effort required for you to prepare a meal yourself.</li>
                    <li>🛏️ The spouse occupies one side of the bed. This reduces available space in the bed but increases perceived realism.</li>
                    <li>📅 The spouse acknowledges certain calendar events, which adds a small degree of additional dialogue variety.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Statistical Analysis</h3>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Interaction</th><th>Practical Benefit</th><th>Engagement Level</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>Walking Together</td><td>None</td><td>Low</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Sitting in Chairs</td><td>None</td><td>Very Low</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Meal Provision</td><td>+1 food item</td><td>Moderate</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Bed Sharing</td><td>Aesthetic only</td><td>Low</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Dialogue on Holidays</td><td>Minor variation</td><td>Low</td></tr>
                </table>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    In summary, the spousal system in cozy farm RPGs is functional but understated.
                    The activities available — such as walking, sitting, and limited dialogue — provide
                    a symbolic representation of companionship. While this may not constitute a high level
                    of interactive depth, it does technically fulfill the feature description of “spending quality time.”

                    <p>
                        Friends, I am delighted to report that paying taxes in Dream Land is
                        simple and enjoyable. All income is calculated by the Star
                        Council, and deductions are already applied for things like cake subsidies and
                        fountain maintenance.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Chart 1: Tax Collection Efficiency</h3>
                    <pre>
Year | % Collected
-------------------
1985 | ██████████ 100%
1986 | ██████████ 100%
1987 | ██████████ 100%
                </pre>

                    <p>
                        Yes, you are reading that correctly. Citizens line up eagerly to
                        contribute, knowing their funds are spent on public gardens, cloud-cleaning,
                        and gourmet festival planning.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Chart 2: Tax Allocation Breakdown</h3>
                    <pre>
Defense       : ██ 10%
Healthcare    : ███ 15%
Infrastructure: ██████ 30%
Dinner        : █████████ 45%
                </pre>

                    <h3>Political Context</h3>
                    <p>
                        Some skeptics abroad complain about inefficiency in their systems. In Dream Land,
                        we simply do not encounter these problems. No paperwork, no audits, no suspicion.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Chart 3: Happiness Index vs. Tax Rate</h3>
                    <pre>
Tax Rate (%) | Happiness
-------------------------
     0       | ███ 30%
    10       | ████████ 80%
    20       | ██████████ 100%
                </pre>

                    <p>
                        As the numbers clearly illustrate, increasing the tax rate has only improved
                        happiness. This is why Dream Land maintains a steady 20% tax policy. Citizens
                        cheer on tax day, often requesting higher rates.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, I can only emphasize again how easy, efficient, and
                        fun the process of taxation is here.
